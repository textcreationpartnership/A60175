            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter is deſcribed the birth of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of <hi>Hagar, Sarahs</hi> handmaid: and it is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable ſtory, as in many reſpects, ſo eſpecially in that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.24.</note> making an Allegory of that aboliſhment of that Legal ſervitude and bondage under the Old Teſtament, by Chriſt under the New: the bond-woman and her ſon were caſt out; and now we are not ſons of the bond-woman, but of the free, as the Apoſtle there ſheweth.</p>
            <p>The Chapter hath four parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The marriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> in the three firſt verſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The viſiting of <hi>Hagar</hi> upon her conceiving; the jar that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah;</hi> together with <hi>Hagars</hi> flight upon her correction, verſ. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Angels coming unto her, and perſwading of her, after the diſcovery of the cauſe of her flight, to return to her Miſtreſs, and to ſubmit her ſelf unto her; and his prediction concerning the childe ſhe went withal, to the 13 verſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the obedience of <hi>Hagar,</hi> together with the birth of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>For the firſt part,<note place="margin">The first Part.</note> which contains the marriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> there is ſet down,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the occaſion of it; <hi>Sarah</hi> had yet born no childe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and ſhe had a handmaid by whom ſhe thought ſhe might have a childe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the cauſes of the Marriage. Firſt, <hi>Sarahs</hi> complaint that God had reſtrained her from bearing. Secondly, her advice to her husband to go in to her maid. Thirdly, her deſire and hope of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41147:14"/> Iſſue: <hi>If perhaps I may obtain children by her.</hi> Fourthly, the yeelding of <hi>Abraham</hi> to this motion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, is conſiderable the manner of knitting this Marriage: <hi>Sarah took Hagar, and gave her to her husband Abraham, to be his wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, the circumſtance of time is conſiderable: <hi>after that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham had dwelt ten yeers in the land of Canaan.</hi> (I ſpare the diviſion of the other parts of the Chapter, till we come to them.)</p>
            <p>For the firſt, it contains the occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sarahs</hi> not having born children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A means ready at hand to ſupply that defect, by means of one that was her ſervant.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Hagar deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note>She is deſcribed,

                  <item>1. From her condition, an handmaid.</item>
                  <item>2. Her country, an Egyptian.</item>
                  <item>3. Her name, <hi>Hagar.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the former clauſe, <hi>Sarah Abrahams wife bare him no children: Sarah Abrahams wife:</hi> there may be ſomething in it, that ſhe is not onely called <hi>Sarah,</hi> but <hi>Abrahams wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sarah why cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Abrahams wife.</note>Firſt, <hi>Ad diſtinctionem,</hi> to diſtinguiſh her from that wife which is ſpoken of at the third verſe: <hi>For Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to be his wife.</hi> (But the difference of wives and concubines, who alſo were called Concubines, we ſhall ſhew, God willing, when we come to that verſe.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſhe is ſtiled <hi>Abrahams wife, In honorem;</hi> and it is no mean honour to her to be the wife of ſo worthy a man as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, ſo renowned for all kinde of vertues, with whom great Princes came up to confederacie, as we ſee in the fourteenth Chapter, and who was accounted as a Prince of God amongſt them, Chap. 28.</p>

There be many interpretations of that place; amongſt the reſt, this is one, That he was <hi>Ornamentum oculorum.</hi> He was an ornament un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her: and certainly nothing that a woman can account a greater ornament unto her, then to have a wiſe, underſtanding, vertuous husband. It is ſaid in the Law, that <hi>Uxor fulget radiis Mariti;</hi> a wife ſhines by the beams of her husband; the more excellent he is, the more honour to her: What an honour to the Church, to have God to be her husband!<note place="margin">Iſai. 54.4.</note>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41147:14"/> which I had put upon thee;</hi> and ſo for that among us, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3, that <hi>the man is the head of the woman,</hi> a Head. In the Hebrew, men are called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and women <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: ſome ſay of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is to forget, becauſe the woman is more forgetful then the man, who is called ſometime <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from his memory: or elſe <hi>per Aphaereſin</hi> men <hi>Anaſhim,</hi> women <hi>Naſhim,</hi> becauſe the man is the Head of the woman: now a Head is not onely put for ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but for excellencie: So that we may ſay, A husband is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of his wife, he puts an honour upon her. What an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was it to <hi>Ruth,</hi> to be the wife of ſuch a worthy man as <hi>Beaz</hi> was! all the people reſpected her for his ſake. And <hi>Abigail</hi> was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the advancement that ſhe ſhould have by becoming <hi>Davids</hi> wife; not ſo much in regard of his greatneſs, for at that time he was under perſecution, as in regard of his goodneſs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And even ſo on the other ſide, a good wife is a great honour to her husband. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.4, that <hi>ſhe is the crown of her husband;</hi> as on the other ſide, ſhe that is naught <hi>makes him aſhamed, and is as rottenneſs in his bones.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.10,<note place="margin">Prov. 31.10.</note> it is ſaid of the good woman, that <hi>her price is far above rubies:</hi> and verſ. 11, <hi>the heart of her husband truſteth in her ſafely:</hi> and verſ. 12, <hi>ſhe will do him good, and not evil, all the days of her life:</hi> mark, (ſaith one) <hi>all the days of her life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A good wife and husband are a mutual credit.</note> It is a happie thing where a wife doth good to her husband ſo long as he lives; but a vertuous woman will do good to him as long as ſhe lives; out-living him, ſhe will carry her ſelf ſo, that he ſhall be honoured by her carriage, even in his aſhes. Again, verſ. 23, it is ſaid, <hi>Her husband is known in the gates, when he ſitteth among the elders of the land:</hi> She takes ſuch care for his apparel and ornaments, that every one looking upon him, ſees how happie he is in ſuch a yoke-fellow, that is ſo ſollicitous for his credit, and ſo is he credited by her.</p>
            <p>I wiſh that this care were found between men and their wives,<note place="margin">Application</note> that they would endeavour to credit each other, that the wife might be honoured for the husbands ſake, and the husband for the wives ſake. What credit had <hi>Abigail</hi> by her husband? and what credit had <hi>Job</hi> by his wife? Could things be kept within doors, it were another matter; but they flee abroad, and the husband is diſcredited ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the wife, and ſometimes the wife by the husband, and they are aſhamed to be known of each other. A heavie caſe, God knows! I would it were as eaſily amended, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſhall we ſay that ſhe is ſtiled <hi>Abrahams wife,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Laſtly, why ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Abrahams wife.</hi> Obſerv. <hi>2.</hi> Tentations inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto both ſexes.</note> that we might take knowledge, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> had his tentation in the former Chapter, ſo the wife hath hers in this. He was troubled becauſe he had no childe, and diſcovered ſome infirmity, which yet God took not advantage of, but ſatisfied his fears. And now his wife is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; ſhe had taken knowledge of the promiſe, but yet ſeeing the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41147:15"/> time deferred, and that it was not ſaid expreſly, that though <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſhould have ſeed, yet he ſhould have it by her, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks her ſelf of a courſe. Thus man and wife may have their turns in tentation, the one may be exerciſed as well as the other: and God in his wiſedom will have it ſo, that they may be a mutual comfort to each other under their afflictions: <hi>Elkanah</hi> the husband was ſo to <hi>Hannah</hi> his wife, when ſhe was troubled for her barrenneſs, and vexed with the inſultation of her colleague,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.</note> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. And the wife of <hi>Manoah</hi> was ſo to him, when he was troubled in that he had ſeen the Angel,<note place="margin">Judges 13.</note> and thought therefore he ſhould die, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13. ſhe raiſeth up his ſpirits, and puts him in heart again by her wiſe ſpeeches.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>A miſerable thing it is, when he that ſhould <hi>dwell with his wife as a man of knowledge</hi> (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) cannot comfort his wife in her trouble, or elſe regards not to do it, but leaves her to pine away in her grief: and alſo when a wife ſeeing her husband in affliction, ſhall have no compaſſion of him, nor ſpeak comfortably unto him; nay, by her frowardneſs, adde to his vexation, as we ſee in <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, who was not <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Firſt, it was to ſhew how God exerciſed the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who though he had given him promiſe of ſeed, yet delays for a long time the accompliſhment of that promiſe.<note place="margin">S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in locum.</note> This is S. <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> Reaſon upon this place: Therefore (ſaith he) are thoſe words uſed, <hi>Sarah bare him no children,</hi> that we might ſee, that after ſo great promiſes made, and ſo many aſſurances paſſed, and yet the thing not done, nay, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>he looked not at</hi> the ſecrets or impediments of nature, but ſtill truſted in God, and waited on him, as knowing whom he had believed.<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>3.</hi> Patience and attendance upon God, is ever well rewarded. S. <hi>Gregory.</hi>
               </note> The performance doth not always hold the promiſe by the heel, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did <hi>Eſau;</hi> for where were then the trial of a mans faith? Faith is <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen:</hi> for, <hi>Quod videtur, ſciri potius quam credi dicitur</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Greg.</hi>) Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſeen, is rather ſaid to be known then believed. And it is the true work of faith, to wait for what God hath promiſed you, though there be no likelihood, in the judgement of fleſh and blood, that it ſhould be performed. <hi>Joſeph</hi> had preſages of his advancements in his dreams, and they even ſo many promiſes of God unto him; and yet we ſee how long it was ere this took effect: yea, God concealed from himſelf the time, though he was able by the ſpirit of Prophecie to inform the Butler of his reſtauration; but ſtill he held himſelf to God, and waited the iſſue. And ſo <hi>David</hi> had a full promiſe of the kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet we know how long God held off, and what danger he waded thorow before he got to the ſhore: this interim was the time of the exerciſe of his faith. So it was with the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their ſervitude in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and likewiſe in their captivity in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> God deferred them till the laſt moment of time, that their faith might have its due employment. I know that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hope deferred is the fainting of the ſoul;</hi> and his father <hi>David</hi> is at his <hi>Uſquequo, Domine?

            </p>
            <p>But now in ſuch a caſe,<note place="margin">Application</note> we muſt take heed of giving way either to our own corruption, or Satans ſuggeſtion, or to joyn in both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when bleſſings promiſed are delayed, to overthrow our faith, to queſtion Gods power, Gods truth, Gods goodneſs. We muſt know, that Gods <hi>arm is not ſhortened,</hi> and he is <hi>Truth; Heaven and earth ſhall</hi>

            <p>A ſecond Reaſon of theſe words is (ſaith another) becauſe God would ſhew, that whenſoever <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould have that ſeed which was promiſed, it ſhould be <hi>ex gratia, non ex natura;</hi> nay, it ſhould be, not natural, but miraculous; for ſhe was now ſeventy five, and <hi>Abraham</hi> was eighty five, &amp; yet it was longer deferred: when therefore it ſhall be effected, it ſhall be Gods miraculous power.</p>

This we ſee in the three children, who were bound and caſt into the midſt of a fiery furnace ſeven times heated: he could have freed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but he would make way for a miracle: They ſhall walk in the midſt of the fire as in a cool arbor,<note place="margin">Baſil.</note> ſaith Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> and when they come out, not ſo much as the ſmell of fire ſhall be found upon them. So in <hi>Daniel,</hi> he ſuffers him to be caſt into the lions den, that he may work a miracle in preſerving him among thoſe fierce companions, who, as is ſaid, were kept hungry, that they might be more greedy of their prey. And ſo he ſuffers <hi>Jonah</hi> to be caſt into the ſea, and to be in the belly of the whale three days, for the manifeſtation of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous power. And our bleſſed Lord on purpoſe did defer that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41147:16"/> turning the water into wine till all the wine was ſpent, that he might do a miracle, and manifeſt his glory, as it is <hi>John</hi> 2.11.<note place="margin">Joh. 2.11.</note> And ſo he deferred on purpoſe to come to <hi>Bethany</hi> till <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead and buried, and had lain ſo many days in the grave; the end was, the glory of God, and that the Son of God might be glorified thereby, <hi>John</hi> 11.4.<note place="margin">Joh. 11.4.</note> And ſo he did not deliver <hi>Paul</hi> and his company till all hope that they ſhould be ſaved was taken away, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.20.</p>
            <p>And as God doth it thus for the manifeſtation of his power, ſo for the increaſe of mens thankfulneſs: for when they reflect upon their former condition and eſtate wherein they were, that it was hopeleſs, and that all natural means were unavailable, and that then God clave to their reſcue; that muſt needs oblige them the more unto him, and make them acknowledge him the ſole Benefactor, and their ſoul the Altar, erected <hi>Jovi liberatori,</hi> to their Almighty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer.

And if it ſhall pleaſe God to bring things thus to paſs, let us be ſure to reflect upon our ſelves the duty of thankfulneſs; and if his favour have been in a fire, let not our thankfulneſs be in a froſt: we may learn both theſe from <hi>Abraham,</hi> in that paſſage of ſacrificing his ſon; he went to the place appointed, he made ready the wood, he bound his ſon, he laid him upon the pile, and he was now fetching the blow: here was an hard exigent: What ſupported him in this, even to the laſt? His faith in Gods power, <hi>that he was able to raiſe him from the dead, and to reſtore him again unto him,</hi> Heb. 11.

Saint <hi>Alban</hi> was converted by obſerving the pious courage of a chriſtian ſouldier. And <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> tells how the godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of Chriſtians wrought upon him.</p>
            <p>And for the Uſe:</p>
            <p>It ſhould teach us, that when we come into ſtrange places,<note place="margin">Application</note> or into ſtrange countries, amongſt ſuch as be prophane, or heatheniſh, we be carefull of our waies; for certainly there is great power in this, to doe good upon them; Words will not doe ſo much, as godly and pious actions; which are <gap reason="foreign">

For how ſhould they like that way that is attended with ſo bad actions? If it be true, the power of it will be ſeen in mens converſation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Muſculus</hi> notes an other thing,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>8.</hi> Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is ever ſtrictly and gratfully to be obſerved.</note> that it was a great providence of God, that <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould bring the <hi>Egyptian</hi> maide along with her into <hi>Canaan;</hi> that as oft as ſhe looked upon her, ſhe might remember the great danger ſhe was in in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court; and how miraculouſly her chaſtity was ſecured; and ſo might be ſtirred up to a daily thankefulneſs, for ſuch a great mercy: and the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes the uſe of it; that we ſhould obſerve the paſſages of Gods providence towards us; remember them, be thankfull for them; for he doth his works ſo, that they ought to be had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall remembrance; our memories are fraile and leaky; they do <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The Hebrews ſpeak of four keys that God keeps in his own power, and gives them not (as they ſay) to any Angels, no not to the Seraphims.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the key of Rain, of which it is ſpoken, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.12, <hi>The Lord ſhall open unto thee his good treaſure, the heavens to give the rain unto thy land in due ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 104.28.</note>The ſecond is the key of Food, of which it is ſpoken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104, <hi>Thou openeſt thy hand, and they are filled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 37.12.</note>The third is the key of the Grave, of which <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37, <hi>Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cauſe you to come up out of your graves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth is the key of the Womb, (as you have heard before:) <hi>God remembred Rachel, and opened her womb,</hi> Gen. 30.</p>
            <p>Some have added to theſe four keys, the key of the Heart: for it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Acts 16.14.</note> 
               <hi>God opened the heart of Lydia, that ſhe attended to Pauls preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Acts 16.14. But this is not one of the Hebrews keys, they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely the four former. And for the laſt, which is the key of the Womb, certainly it is in Gods own keeping. <hi>Children are the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 127.3.</note> 
               <hi>and the fruit of the womb is his reward,</hi> Pſal. 127.</p>
            <p>Now for the Uſe of this.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Firſt, it may teach man and wife, in the want of children, not to murmure againſt each other, and to chalenge each other of inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; for it is God that reſtrains the fruitfulneſs of the womb: and we ſee that thoſe that are in their youth and ſtrength, and moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the judgement of fleſh and blood, want iſſue; and why ſo?

            <p>Who takes not knowledge of the complaints and repinings that are between married couples in this kinde? Which are certainly unreaſonable and unjuſt, becauſe they chalenge each other for that which is not in their own power. We ſee how paſſionate <hi>Rachel</hi> is, and how ſhe ſeems to caſt the fault upon her husband; ſhe ſaith unto
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41147:20"/> him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. <hi>Give me children, or elſe I die.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 30.1.</note> But he anſwers her very wiſely and fully, with a juſt acrimony and ſharpneſs: <hi>His anger was kindled againſt her, and he ſaid, Am I in Gods ſtead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?</hi>
               <note place="margin">A juſt Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſeveral offenders.</note> And ſo ſometimes the husband is ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of the wife: and thoſe unkinde murmurings Satan takes ſuch advantage of, that he puts them on to drink of ſtollen waters, and to try elſewhere, that they may be ſatisfied in their own ſufficiency; which is a fearful precipice, to ſin againſt God, and againſt their own bodies, and againſt the Marriage-bed, onely to give themſelves ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>Away then with querulous complaints againſt each other; and if it hath pleaſed God to reſtrain children, let them not upbraid each other, but love each other the more tenderly;<note place="margin">S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in locum.</note> and by mutual comfort eaſe the common grievance. S. <hi>Chryſostom</hi> obſerves of <hi>Sarah</hi> here, She did not lay any fault upon her husband, nor did he upon her: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; He upbraided her not with her barrenneſs; but ſhe honoured him, and he lovingly reſpected her.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.</note> And the like we ſhall ſee in <hi>Elkanah,</hi> who gave unto his wife <hi>Hannah a worthy portion, for he loved her; but the Lord had ſhut up her womb, and her adverſary provoked her, to make her fret:</hi> He conſidered that ſhe was barren, and that ſhe was vexed for it by her colleague, and therefore he is the more kinde unto her; and when ſhe <hi>weeps from day to day, and refuſeth her meat,</hi> he <hi>ſpeaks kindly unto her, Why art thou grieved? am not I bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to thee then ten ſons?</hi> Here was a loving husband indeed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it may alſo ſtay that proud ſpirit of inſultation that is in many, who are apt, not onely to lift up themſelves above others, but to reproach them, if they have children, and the others barren. Why, do they conſider that it is God that reſtrains women from bearing of children; and dare they reproach them for that which is not in the power of their redreſs? This was <hi>Peninnahs</hi> fault in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>Hannah;</hi> ſhe had children, and <hi>Hannah</hi> had none, therefore ſhe inſulted over her, and vexed her. Such hath been the corruption of peoples mindes in all times, that barrenneſs hath been accounted a reproach; therefore <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.23. Luke 1.25.</note> when ſhe had conceived and born a ſon, that God had <hi>taken away her reproach,</hi> Gen 30. And <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the mother of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> ſaith (having conceived, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.) <hi>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me, in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</hi> But certainly it is an unjuſt reproach, nay it is irreligious; for it doth imply a denial, at leaſt a queſtioning, of that power and ſoveraignty that God hath over the conception and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of children.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if God reſtrain from bearing, it will not juſtifie thoſe that do what is in them to reſtrain themſelves from bearing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Some baſe ones, that they may more freely give themſelves to their luſt, uſe means that they may not conceive: others that be in the married eſtate, do it for fear of the pains and terrour of child-birth:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41147:21"/> and others, by their ungodly and ſinful courſes, make God keep from them this bleſſing.<note place="margin">Levit. 20.20.</note> God threatens the inceſtuous copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with want of children; <hi>They ſhall die childleſs: Juſtum eſt</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>ut ſteriles è mundo,</hi> that they ſhould go barren out of the world: And ſo <hi>Michal,</hi> for her mocking of her husband, <hi>had no childe till the day of her death.</hi> And even thoſe that having conceived by their wanton hoytings, or needleſs watchings, or <hi>Epicurean</hi> feeding, prevent themſelves of bringing forth in due time;<note place="margin">Hoſea 9.14.</note> they draw that upon them, which God threatens as a judgement, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.) <hi>a miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying womb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If it be God that reſtrains the bearing of children, then they that want them know to what fountain to come to draw this bleſſing;<note place="margin">Gen. 15.2. and 25.21.</note> even unto God. To him did <hi>Abraham</hi> addreſs himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.2. And to him did <hi>Iſaac</hi> pray, when his wife was barren. <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.<note place="margin">Luke 1.13.</note> And to him did <hi>Hannah</hi> ſeek, and pour out her ſoul, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10. And to him did <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſue, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.13. Let people be as paſſionate and tumultuous as they will, as we ſee in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> yet they can have no childe, till God open the wombe; (they muſt pray to God:) And again it teacheth them who have received the bleſſing, to whom to be thankfull: let them not look upon their own bodies, but look up to Heaven, from whence every good comes; and ſay, as you heard <hi>Jacob</hi> before; theſe are the children which God hath given me; and as his wife <hi>Leah,</hi> who gives names to her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.3.</note> that carry the acknowledgment of Gods gift unto her; as <hi>Eve</hi> did, who having a Son, ſaid, <hi>I have gotten a man from the Lord, Gen.</hi> 4. And let me add, that as parents acknowledg with all thankfulneſs the gift, ſo let them uſe their children as Gods gift, and to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Doner. The parents of <hi>Sampſon</hi> were glad they ſhould have a childe, but withall they deſired, that the Angell may come again to inform them,<note place="margin">Judges 13.</note> what they ſhall doe to the childe, when it ſhall be born; that nothing may be defective on their part, to make him an inſtrument of Gods glory. <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. And we ſee that as <hi>Hannah</hi> is glad of her ſon, and in the name ſhe gives him, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth Gods gift, <hi>Samuel;</hi> ſo ſhe dedicates him to the ſervice of God. Let your care be whom God bleſſeth with children, to give them to the Lord, vow them to his ſervice; and when they be capable, inlay them with the rudiments of Religion, that they may even ſuck it in with their milke; (as it is ſaid of Saint <hi>Baſil;</hi>) that they may be acquainted with it,<note place="margin">Timothy</note> as <hi>Timothy</hi> was with the Scripture, even <hi>from a childe;</hi> and ſet them too a good example for this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Greek Father ſpeaks;<note place="margin">Chryſoſtome.</note> this domeſticall pattern of goodneſs is very prevalent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Follow them with your prayers; by this means they ſhall be <hi>ſemen ſanctum, i.e.</hi> an holy ſeed; your ſons ſhall be holy plants, and your daughters as the poliſhed corners of the temple.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Not to ſtay too long upon this point, not onely in regard
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41147:21"/> of children, but in the want of other bleſſings, that we ſtand in need of, and doe deſire; we ſhould obſerve the reſtraining hand of God. If we have not the latitude of health that we would have, we muſt acknowledg it to be Gods doing; if we have not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of eſtate that will ſerve to maintain our charge, we muſt make account it is the Lords diſpenſation; if we want the inward comfort that our ſouls long for, we muſt know that it is God that reſtrains it, and hath put our ſun behinde a cloud: So in regard of the publique; if we have not fruitful ſeaſons, if we lack the firſt and latter rain, if the times be more cloudy and fuller of diſtraction, if the Goſpell hath not ſo free a paſſage, we muſt ſee Gods work in all theſe things; <hi>There is no evill in a City, which the Lord hath not done,</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks:) he enlargeth or reſtraineth himſelf, as he pleaſeth: If we could thus look up to him and his hand, we could not ſtick in ſecond cauſes, which begets murmuring and meditation of revenge; we would ſeek to him, and till he anſwer us, wait with patience.</p>
            <p>We now come to the ſecond cauſe of the marriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Hagar;</hi> and that is <hi>Sarahs</hi> requeſt to her husband, to goe in to her maide; the connexion of which with the former, Saint <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> makes to be ſuch, that he may free <hi>Sarah</hi> from all blame;<note place="margin">

Now thus in the face of it, (though, as afterward we ſhall ſhew, God willing, there was weakneſs and ſin in it) in the face of it (I ſay,) it carries that true reſpect, which the wife ſhould have to the husband; to tender his contentment above her own: We ſhall ſee that when <hi>Iacob</hi> moveth his wives, for his return to his own country; though they muſt needs have a great affection to their Country, and their Fathers houſe; yet ſeeing it was their husbands pleaſure, grounded upon Gods command, they willingly ſubmit to follow him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.<note place="margin">Gen. 31.16.</note>

            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Now it were much to be wiſhed that this leſſon were taken out: but out of doubt, as it hath been in former times, ſo there is ſtill a great defect this way. The love that <hi>Lots</hi> wife bare to <hi>Sodome,</hi> was a great means of delaying of her husbands comming out of that place; ſhe ſought her own contentment, rather then his, or her own ſafety: The reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> forbare the circumciſing of his ſecond childe, was the offence that his wife took at the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the firſt; no queſtion he had acquainted her with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the omiſſion! but what cares ſhe ſo ſhe may content her ſelf, to expoſe him to a judgment! And are there not too many ſo affected in theſe times, that care not, ſo they have their content, though it be to their husbands prejudice: They muſt dwell where they have a minde, not where he deſireth: they muſt have theſe and theſe cloathes, and theſe and theſe Iewels, though oftentimes theſe be the ſick feathers of a declining eſtate, that they are plumed withal; many a wife makes the husband in the latter end, ſit down and complain in the words of <hi>Adam; mulier quam dediſti,</hi> the woman whom thou gaveſt me, hath deceived me. Let the husband be ſick, they will be of thoſe that ſhall do leaſt about him; they will not break their reſt and ſleep, to attend him: Let the husband ſtay at home, mourning for want of his ſociety and aſſiſtance, while they take their vagaries, and pleaſe themſelves in their recreations: this is not to be a daughter of <hi>Sarah,</hi> and to do as ſhe did, who is ſaid to have <hi>obeyed</hi> him, and <hi>called him Lord,</hi> and in all things ſtudied his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and was moſt earneſt to do that which ſhe thought might moſt comfort him.

            <p>For the Uſe of it:</p>
            <p>Let us take heed of this: If we ſuffer want in our eſtate,<note place="margin">Application</note> let us not uſe unlawful means to better it: As <hi>Abraham</hi> would not be enriched by the King of <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſo much as a ſhoe-ſatchet; ſo let us ſcorn to be beholding to the ways of fraud, for increaſing our means. There is no compariſon between <gap reason="foreign">

               <note place="margin">Peleuſiota.</note>) between Poverty and Impiety: better be poor to a Proverb, as <hi>Job</hi> was, then that it ſhould be ſaid, Satan hath made us rich. Want we meat, (though, I confeſs, that is a great exigent) yet let us not ſteal, to ſatisfie hunger. Our Lord, though he was an hungred, would not hearken to Satan, to make bread of ſtones; neither would he <hi>fall down and worſhip</hi> him, to gain the whole world. Have we loſt our goods, or are we in great want of health? Shall we run to Wizards and Wiſe-men, (as they falſly call them) to be helped? or uſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Incantations? Oh no! This is to caſt out the devil by <hi>Beelzebub;</hi> when God hath wounded us, to make Satan our phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. Are we in terrour of conſcience, and ſhall we betake our ſelves to drinking, and ſwilling, and unlawful kindes of ſports? Will this help us? Is this the harp that will conjure that ill ſpirit? Will not this be bitterneſs in the concluſion? Will not this be as cold water taken in the height of a hot Fever, which maketh the broyling drought, after a while, the greater?</p>
            <p>Why, (but will ſome ſay) what would you have us do, when comfort and eaſe bloweth from no corner?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Be <hi>dumb before the ſhearers,</hi> and ſtill wait upon God, and remember that power and ſoveraignty that he hath over us; how all things that he giveth us, he giveth them, and taketh them from us: and taking but his own, muſt he loſe a friend of us?</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may be God keepeth us under the hatches, for our future good, and to <hi>do us good in the later end,</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let us know, that all the means that we can uſe, without God, may ſoon prove unavailable; nay not onely ſo, but pernitious; &amp; both increaſe our ſin &amp; condemnation.

            <p>Why, (but may ſome man ſay) why doth ſhe propound this, that he ſhould <hi>go in to the maid?</hi> How did ſhe know but the maid might deny ſuch a ſervice as this was?</p>
            <p>It may be thought that ſhe was perſwaded of her ſervants obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this kinde; and ſhe might preſume upon that command that ſhe had over her, being her ſervant.</p>

            <p>I confeſs it is a groſs abuſe of that dominion that God hath given to maſters and miſtreſſes over ſervants, to engage them into ſin, and make them ſerve them in baſe ways; to make them panders or bauds to their luſt; to make them oppreſſors of their tenants; to make them lye, and ſwear, and forſwear, in their behalf; to make them exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of their unjuſt revenge. And it is no leſs fearful on the other ſide, when ſervants loſe all ſenſe of conſcience towards God, to ſhew their obedience toward their maſters: for they are tied onely to obey <hi>in Domino, in the Lord;</hi> ſo to ſerve their <hi>earthly maſters,</hi> as they may anſwer it to their <hi>Maſter in heaven.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Now for the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>How ſhould it teach us to abhor all filthineſs! yea, that it ſhould not <hi>be once named among us, as becometh Saints,</hi> Eph. 5.<note place="margin">Eph. 5.3.</note> as <hi>he which hath called us is holy;</hi> ſo ſhould we be holy <hi>in all manner of converſation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. Our thoughts ſhould be clean. <hi>I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then ſhould I look upon a maid?</hi> Job 6.31. Our very ſpeculative and contemplative uncleanneſs, is the luſting of the heart: the unclean roving thoughts of men, are ſins before God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our looks and aſpects ſhould be free from filthineſs: for the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>eyes full of adultery,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our apparel ſhould be modeſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>Let women adorn themſelves in modeſt apparel, with ſhamefac'dneſs and ſobriety.</hi> And that woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.10. is ſaid to have <hi>the attire of an harlot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There ſhould be modeſty in our ſpeech. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Let your ſpeech be always with grace, ſeaſoned with ſalt:</hi> and, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to edifying, that it may miniſter grace unto the hearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why?</p>
            <p>Firſt, our tongue is <hi>our glory,</hi> ſo called more then once by <hi>David</hi> in the Pſalms: and it is that member, above all, that is given us to <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God</hi> withal: and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, he will praiſe God with the <hi>beſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> that he hath.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is great force in broad and unclean ſpeech, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the heart, and ſet it on fire with filthy luſt. <hi>Be not deceived,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.33.</note> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>evil words corrupt good manners,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; that is, <hi>rotten communication,</hi> Eph. 4.29. becauſe they are apt to corrupt and putrifie thoſe that hear them. The Naturaliſt telleth of one creature that conceiveth by the ear; and ſo it falleth out, that by the ear wickedneſs is conceived, and the ſoul tainted.</p>
            <p>I would this were well remembred: for we may ſay as <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> we <hi>dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips.</hi> People ſpeak moſt filthily,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41147:24"/> ſo that they are a burthen to any civil eare: and they will call for ſongs, that are full of nothing but ribaldry; which is all one, as if they ſpoke them themſelves: and what will they ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Though they ſpeak thus, yet they meane no hurt; their hearts are as good as the beſt; but this not poſſible, <hi>for thoſe things which proceed out of the mouth, come from the heart, and defile the man.</hi> Mat. 15.<note place="margin">Mat. 15.18.</note> and Mat. 12.34. <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh:</hi> Is the fountain ſweet, that ſendeth forth ſtinking water?</p>
            <p>Secondly, They ſay they ſpeak but in mirth: but I ſay, this is a fig-leafe too narrow to cover that nakedneſs; for cannot man be merry without offending God? Fooliſh talking and jeſting are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle:</hi>

               <hi>ut non patiatur conſortium in re amata:</hi> Jealouſie is a vehement paſſion or affection of the minde towards a beloved object, not ſuffering any rival or co-partnerſhip in the thing affected. Jealouſie, in it ſelf ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, is not reprovable: God himſelf is ſaid to be <hi>a jealous God,</hi> in the ſecond Commandment:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.2.</note> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. that he was <hi>jealous over them with a godly jealouſie.</hi> And who can blame him that loveth his wife heartily, if he be fearful of any that would ſhare with him? But the jealouſie that is reprovable, is, when husbands or wives, upon light and ſlight grounds, (nay, oftentimes,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41147:25"/> upon no grounds, but their own conceits and apprehenſions, grow ſuſpitious of each other, and ſo make their condition uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for the moſt ingenious malice could never invent ſuch a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this. They that are vexed with this ill ſpirit, can take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in any thing: ſometimes they grow mad and deſperate; but too too often fall upon revenge, and even wound the innocent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tully</hi> telleth how <hi>Thebe,</hi> the wife of <hi>Alexander Pheraius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pertinent Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.</note> ſlew her husband, becauſe ſhe ſuſpected him of incontinency. And <hi>Zonares</hi> tells how <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> a worthy woman, and wife to <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, having received of the Emperour her husband an apple of an incredible bigneſs, ſhe gave it to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> a learned man <hi>Paulinus</hi> not knowing from whom the Empreſs had received it, giveth it, as a rare gift, to the Emperour. Hereupon, the Emperour ſendeth for his wife, and asketh her what ſhe had done with the apple. She (becauſe he did ſo earneſtly enquire after it) fearing, that if ſhe had ſaid ſhe had given it away, he would have been diſpleaſed, anſwered, that ſhe had eaten it. He urging her to tell the truth, ſhe ſwore ſhe had eaten it. Whereupon, the jealous Emperour ſlew innocent <hi>Paulinus,</hi> and hated his wife: his jealouſie was ſtirred, and he broke out into this unreaſonable revenge. This is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.34, 35. <hi>Jealouſie is the rage of a man; therefore he will not ſpare in the day of vengeance: he will not regard any ranſom, neither will he reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, though thou givest many gifts.</hi> And ſome have made Jealouſie to be a compound of Love, Fear, and Anger: a man loveth, and therefore he fears partnerſhip; and therefore is enraged, even out of the ſuſpition of it: if he dare not revenge, he pineth away, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up his heart in a ſecret diſcontentment.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Application</note> let it teach man and wife to take heed of giving way to idle and vagabond phancies and ſuſpitions; not to think, becauſe they are fair, they are like to be falſe; or to judge an affable and chearful carriage, to be an enſigne of lewdneſs; or every look caſt upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be a broker for luſt; or to be in company of ſuch a one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are diſhoneſt: This is raſh judgement; nay, this is not <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium,</hi> but <hi>vitium;</hi> this is not judgement, but vice, and paſſion; contrary to true love, that, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>hopeth all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth all things,</hi> and is ready to interpret doubtful things to the beſt: this is to wrong thy yoke-fellow; and Satan purpoſely caſteth in, and fomenteth ſuch ſuſpitions, meerly to ſowre this ſweet condition: and this is to make way for thine own torment: this is not <hi>tollere cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,</hi> to take up thy croſs, when it is laid upon thee; but <hi>creare crucem,</hi> to make a croſs, and to lay it upon thy ſelf.</p>

But as <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid of a wife, ſo I ſay both of man and wife; They muſt not onely be free from act, but even from the ſuſpition of evil: and the Apoſtle wiſheth them to <hi>abſtain from all appearance of evil;</hi> which if they do not, they ſin againſt God, ſin againſt their neighbour, in giving him occaſion to judge uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; ſin againſt the married eſtate, by which they are bound to ſtudy each others contentment, and not willingly to do the leaſt thing that may diſtaſte each other.<note place="margin">

               <hi>If I may obtain children by her.</hi> Here the Fathers and Expoſitors do acquit her of luſt, and take knowledge of her deſire onely to have a childe; and that not onely for the contentment of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but that the world might be made happie: for God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a bleſſing to the world in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed.</p>
            <p>I do eaſily condeſcend unto them, that ſhe had no unclean pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. 16. de civit.

            <p>But yet to juſtifie her or him in this action, which the Fathers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, I cannot: For,

            </p>
            <p>We know the peremptory rule of the Apoſtle, that <hi>evil muſt not be done, that good may come of it,</hi> Rom. 3. When <hi>Lot</hi> proſtituted his daughters, he intended good in it; and that was, The preſervation of the laws of hoſpitality, and the ſecurity of his gueſts: but he cannot be juſtified in it, becauſe the thing which he did, was ſimply unlawful in it ſelf. I know what is ſaid, that, Of two evils, he did chuſe the leſs: he deſired that they ſhould <hi>coire ſecundùm naturam;</hi> (ſeeing their wicked reſolution) that they ſhould keep the courſe of nature, rather then, <hi>è contra,</hi> at once to violate nature and hoſpitality. But this will not ſerve the turn: for though in evils that be <hi>poena,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41147:26"/> evils of puniſhment, a man may chuſe the leſs; <hi>ubi homo inermis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venitur,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory;</hi>) as,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Gregory.</note> when a man unarmed is ſurpriſed by his deſperate enemy, it is lawful to leap down ſome opportunity of eſcape: yet in thoſe which be <hi>culpae,</hi> thoſe evils of ſin, neither is to be choſen: And therefore they ſpeak more truly and ſafely, that make it an infirmity in him, and caſt onely this cloke over it; that he did it <hi>animo perturbato,</hi> out of a troubled minde, ſuddenly, and not being well adviſed. The midwives of <hi>Egypt</hi> could not preſerve the males alive, but by inventing ſome cleanly ſhift, whereby to delude <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and therefore they reſolve upon a lye.

And though it be ſaid, that <hi>God built them houſes,</hi> Exod. 1. yet Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> will tell us, <hi>Remunerata eſt benignitas mentis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note> 
               <hi>non ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas mentientis:</hi> that God did there recompence the tenderneſs of their minde, not the iniquity of their lye. <hi>Saul</hi> pretended a good end, in ſparing the fat things of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> that therewith he might <hi>ſacrifice to the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. but that would not excuſe him;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> for he flatly <hi>tranſgreſſed Gods commandment. Uzzah</hi> intended the ſafety of Gods Ark; he <hi>ſtretched out his hand, to ſtay it from falling:</hi> but God interpreted this, preſumption, and accordingly puniſhed it: for it <hi>belonged not to</hi> him, ſo much as to touch the Ark, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.</note> Doubtleſs Saint <hi>Peter</hi> meant no harm, but rather good to Chriſt, when he took him aſide, and diſſwaded him from his paſſion: But we ſee how ſharply Chriſt rebukes him for it. Certainly no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not of the beſt end, and the greateſt good, will bear a man out in the doing of that which is ſimply evil.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe (as the School ſpeaks) <hi>malum non eſt in numero eligibilio um;</hi> evil is not in the number of things to be made choice of; and therefore neither to be choſen for its own ſake, nor yet <hi>propter aliud bonum,</hi> for any other good conſequent whatſoever: for, <hi>actus peccati non eſt ordinabilis in bonum finem:</hi> no act of ſin is in its nature orderable to any good end. In moral actions, if, for any intended end, we make choice of ſuch means as by the Law of God (which ought to be our rule) are ineligible, that action cannot be juſtified.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Bonum eſt ex cauſa integra, malum ex partiali:</hi> Any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or particular defect, in object, end, manner, or other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is enough to make the whole action bad: but to make it good, there muſt be an univerſal concurrence of all requiſite condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in every of theſe reſpects. To make the face deformed, the want of an eye or noſe is enough: but to make it comely, there is required the due proportion of every part.</p>

                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note> to procure the benefit of them; but this cannot be juſtified, for Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> will tell us; that <hi>nullo bonae cauſae obtutu,</hi> no pretence or intent of any good will juſtifie us, in doing of that which is evil; and he will not have one lye for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of anothers chaſtity, of anothers life; nay <hi>ad ſempirer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ſalutem nullus ducendus eſt opitu lante mendacio;</hi> no man is to be led unto eternal life it ſelf, by the conduct of a lye: the glory of God is the greateſt good, and the higheſt end, and yet a lye may not be told for that.<note place="margin">Iob. 13.7.</note> 
               <hi>Job</hi> asketh them, Ch. 13. <hi>Will you ſpeak wickedly for God, and talke deceitfully for him?</hi> and if not for the glory of God; Certainly not for any inferior end.

Shall a man ſteal leather, to make the poor ſhooes? Shall a man purloyn from his maſter, or the wife from the husband, to beſtow it upon works of charity? Satan taketh great advantage from hence, that men can plead an intendment of good; for by this means, ſin is not only boldly committed, but ſtoutly defended; as we ſee in thoſe our Saviour ſpeaketh of,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.2.

            <p>In the ſecond place, let it teach children to keep up the houſe, as much as in them lyeth; if their parents and anceſtors have been vertuous, let them tread in their ſteps; let them put them on, (as it was ſaid of the ſons of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">

And yet ſuch fools there are, too many in the world: they take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward courſes, out of an hope to make themſelves rich; and yet it is but a perhaps, whether their lives ſhall hold, or not: they uſe vitious ways, to get honour; and yet its but perhaps, whether they ſhall attain unto it.<note place="margin">

            <p>I come now to the fourth cauſe of the marriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah;</hi> and that is, <hi>Abrahams</hi> yeelding to the motion of his wife: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; He liked of the counſel and reſolution, to follow it:<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>5.</hi> Uxeriouſneſs oft ſinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly.</note> Which howſoever the Fathers would palliate, yet we cannot but charge him with a ſinful uxoriouſneſs. It ſhould ſeem, he had ſome freſh deſire, upon her ſpeech, to be a father, though by this by-way: And again; his wife pretending ſo much care of him, and affection unto him, and ſtudy of his contentment; he thought, by neglecting her advice, he might diſpleaſe: <hi>Et metuit contriſtari,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Toſtatus</hi> in loc.</note> (as <hi>Toſtatus</hi> ſaith) he was loath to grieve her. This (I ſay) was a ſinful uxoriouſneſs, ſuch as was in <hi>Adam,</hi> that was perſwaded
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41147:28"/> by his wife, to eat of the forbidden fruit: and<note n="*" place="margin">Eſpenſaeus.</note> one ſaith, He fell not ſo much out of an errour of judgement, as <hi>ex ſociali neceſsitudine, &amp; amicabili benevolentia;</hi> out of the attraction of ſociety, and friendly compliance with his partner. So it was the fault of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would yeeld ſo far to his wife, as to neglect the circumciſing of his childe, to give her contentment. And <hi>Solomon</hi> was uxorious, in yeelding to his wives for the practice of idolatry: the ſame (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) pay not, as he did, becauſe he would not <hi>dalicius contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtari;</hi> practiſed as they did, leſt he ſhould offend his concubines. Thus uxorious was <hi>Ahab,</hi> who was ſwayed by his wife, to do as ſhe would have him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.<note place="margin">1 Kings 21.</note> he is ſaid to have done evil <hi>by the inſtigation of Jezebel.</hi> And inſtances are very frequent in theſe times, of thoſe, both Magiſtrates and others, that liſten ſo much to the counſel of wives, and their pleadings, that buſineſſes are wrong carried, and their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands diſcredited, yea ſometimes ruined.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>Let husbands beware of this uxoriouſneſs.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Application</hi> Gen. 21.12.</note> Wherein wives adviſe well, let them hearken unto them: as God ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 21. <hi>In all that Sarah hath ſaid unto thee, hearken unto her voice.</hi> And it had been well for <hi>Haman,</hi> if he had liſtned to that which <hi>Zereſh</hi> ſaid to him; <hi>If Mordecai be of the ſeed of the Jews, before whom thou haſt begun to fall, thou ſhalt not prevail againſt him.</hi> And for <hi>Pilate,</hi> if he had hearkened to the meſſage his wife ſent him: <hi>Have thou nothing to do with that juſt man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when they ſhall adviſe that which is evil, we muſt ever take heed of hearkening to them: we muſt rather chuſe to diſpleaſe them, then God. God giveth caution, that <hi>if the wiſe that lieth in</hi> a mans <hi>boſome, ſhall entice him to idolatry; he ſhall not hearken unto her,</hi> Deut. 13.6. And it was a worthy diſpoſition in <hi>David,</hi> who, when his wife reproved him for dancing before the Ark; anſwereth, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that if it were to do again, he would do it; his edge ſhould not be taken off by her flout; yea, he would <hi>be more vile</hi> before his God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. And it was a good Spirit in <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.</note> when his wife moved him to that which was evil; he rejected her, and telleth her, She <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth like a fooliſh woman:</hi> and ſo ſhe did indeed, that upbraided him with conſtant uprightneſs, and would have him <hi>curſe God, and die.</hi> It is true, that much may be done in things indifferent, to give the wife ſatisfaction: for elſe there may be that in an houſe, which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> calleth <hi>a continual dropping.</hi> But in things unlawful, for an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to yeeld to the wife, is that which offendeth God, and forfeiteth that authority which God hath given him, in regard of his wife. And let me adviſe wives, not to preſume upon the intereſt they have in the affection of their husbands, to purſue upon them that which they may not lawfully do. They are ill yoke-fellows, that would wiſh them to offend God, for the giving of them ſatisfaction: to ſlight ſin againſt God, ſo they may have their will. They ſhould be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41147:29"/> helpful, and not hurtful: they ſhould make their judgements to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their husbands, and no way affect that their paſſion ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his reaſon.</p>
            <p>Again: obſerve, how free <hi>Abraham</hi> was from the thought of any indirect courſe, to haſten Gods work, till this was propounded by his wife; he did patiently wait Gods leaſure: And though every day he grew older, and more unlikely, in the judgement of fleſh and blood, to have a childe; yet he gave credit to Gods promiſe, and in much meekneſs expected the accompliſhment: and now, upon this ſuggeſtion of his wife, we ſee how he goeth in. We may ſee
<q>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>3.</hi> The force of temptation, and frailty of the beſt.</note>How apt we are to fall, when temptation cometh.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, we know not our ſelves, or our own ſtrength, till then. And therefore they are called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>temptations:</hi> for they do <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, broach the veſſel, and ſee what is in it: <hi>Talis quiſpiam, qualis in tentatione;</hi> for, ſuch is every one, as he is in temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 12.</note>
               <hi>Abrahams</hi> danger in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 12. was a bold temptation; and we ſee there how he carrieth it. <hi>Moſes,</hi> that was the ſweeteſt ſpirited man in the world; yet <hi>at the waters of ſtrife</hi> is tempted, and ſpeaks <hi>unadviſedly. David,</hi> that was free from luſt before; yet, upon the ſight of the woman waſhing her ſelf, was tempted and overcome. And ſo it was with his ſon <hi>Solomon;</hi> and with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> upon the coming of the King of <hi>Babels</hi> meſſengers. And ſo it was with <hi>Peter,</hi> for all his former proteſtations; yet, being tempted, through the fear of loſing his life, he was conquered: And ſo afterward, when he halted between the Jew and the Gentile, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Who findes not this? Though we can bid defiance to temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when they are abſent, and ſay, Oh, we would not be thus and thus; yet when they preſent themſelves, we are too ſoon foiled by them. Places and Offices have corrupted ſome men, that were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt before: Company hath tempted thoſe, that came in pure: Some occaſion offered for theft or luſt, hath ſubdued a man ſuddenly, that never before had the like motion.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Let us pray then, as our Saviour biddeth us, that we <hi>enter not into temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, labour we to fortifie our hearts with grace, and fear them with the fear of God; that when temptations come, we may be able to reſiſt them. 'Tis nothing for a man to be chaſte, where there is no tentation to uncleanneſs; for a man to be temperate at a poor and lean table; to be meek and moderate, when we are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked: nothing for the ſervant not to ſteal, when his maſters eye is upon him: But, when temptation cometh, then to ſtand upright, argueth the power of grace: As we ſee in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſollicited by his miſtreſs; and <hi>David,</hi> when he had <hi>Saul</hi> in the cave, and all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances invited him to take revenge.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whenſoever we are foiled by temptation, let us blame
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41147:29"/> our ſelves; for did not we yield, we could not be overcome: it is not in the power of any man or woman living; nay not of Satan himſelf to hurt us, if we could keep our own: Satan <hi>ſuadere poteſt, cogere non poteſt,</hi> (ſaith the Father:) <hi>non extorquet conſenſum, ſed petit.</hi> The devil may perſwade, but he cannot compell; he doth not inforce conſent, but begg it: He may <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>i.e.</hi> He may ſeduce, but he cannot neceſſitate us: <hi>Sarahs</hi> temptation had been fruſtrate, if <hi>Abraham</hi> had not yielded; and therefore let us lay the blame, where it ſhould lye; challenge not God, nor men, nor Satan, but our own deceitful hearts; for every man (ſaith the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) when he is tempted, is drawn away by his own concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Obſerve here, that though <hi>Abraham</hi> had before been tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtood it out manfully; yet here he yieldeth and gives in: when he was called out of his own country, you may well think he ſuffered a ſhrewd aſſault, to leave his dwelling, his friends and kindred, and all his accommodations, and yet he overcame thoſe difficulties; afterwards when diſſention was between his and <hi>Lots</hi> herdmen; and no queſtion, he was tempted to ſtand upon his ſeniority and precedency; he had been the maker of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew under God; and therefore why ſhould not he ſubmit to his conditions; and yet for peace ſake, he conquereth himſelf ſo far, as to yield of his own right, and to give <hi>Lot</hi> the liberty of choice. Again, there was a tentation lay in the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sodoms</hi> offer of the ſpoiles unto him; and yet he is ſo reſolute, that he will not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, ſo much as a ſhooe-latchet by him: and yet now, when this tentation commeth, here he yieldeth, and hearkneth to the voice of his wife: why did he not ſay to her upon her motion? My dear wife, I am not ſo blinde or ſtupid, as not to diſcern the great care that thou haſt of my contentment; and how willingly ſhould I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; but that the thing is not lawfull in it ſelf, and would argue diffidence in the promiſe of God, on which I have depended all this while: both thou and I are to yield our ſelves to God, and not to preſcribe him the time or manner of beſtowing the bleſſing: I dare not condeſcend unto thee in this particular; but none of all this ſaid he, but as ſoon as ſhe mooveth, he conſenteth; and thus we ſee;</p>
            <p>That it is poſſible for the childe of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 7.</note> that quitteth himſelf well in one temptation, to be foiled by another. <hi>David</hi> that bore himſelf well, in that untoward carriage of <hi>Saul</hi> towards him; yet fayleth when he is provoked by <hi>Nabal,</hi> and preſently voweth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: and though he carryed himſelf well, in the rayling of <hi>Shimet;</hi> yet not ſo well at <hi>Abſolons</hi> death: <hi>Job</hi> at firſt was ſo patient, that he did not ſin with his mouth; but afterward he ſpeaketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly: And <hi>Jonah,</hi> that is of a meek ſpirit when he is detected in the ſhip, is in a <hi>Voge</hi> becauſe of the gourd; and we finde it thus ordinarily: he that quitted himſelf well in a temptation to ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41147:30"/> hath fayled when he hath been tempted to covetouſneſs; and he that quitted himſelf well in both the former, hath failed in a tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to luſt and uncleanneſs: He that hath reſiſted drunkenneſs, yet hath yielded to gluttony.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Firſt, for others: Let us be tender in our cenſures of them, when they are carried away, by this or that temptation; it is incident to the beſt; and we know not how their temptations have been edged: neither let us deſpair of them, becauſe they have been foiled, that they will ſtill hereafter go by the worſe; no, they may recover themſelves, and be more valiant; (as it is ſaid of <hi>Caſtiis</hi> and <hi>Emilius</hi> in Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Cyprian.</note>) <hi>fortiores ab ignibus facti ſunt, quibus ante ceſſerant;</hi> their chriſtian fortitude was the more kindled, by the ſight of thoſe flames, which before they ſtartled at; the old ſaying was, he that flyeth, may fight again.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.10.</note>Secondly, For our ſelves, let us not preſume on't; (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith; 1 Cor. 10.) <hi>Let him that ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall;</hi> Let us not be <hi>high-minded, but fear,</hi> conſidering how many ſnares lye in our way, and how weak we are of our ſelves.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He three firſt verſes of this Chapter, (as I told you in the diviſion of it) contained the marriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>Hagar, Sarahs</hi> handmaid. And therein four things obſervable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The occaſion of this marriage, in the firſt verſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The proper cauſes of it, in the ſecond verſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The knitting of this knot, in this third verſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Together with the fourth thing, which is, the aſſignation of the time when this marriage was made: namely, <hi>After Abraham had dwelt ten yeers in the land of Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have done with the Occaſion, and the Cauſes: Now we come to the knitting of the knot: <hi>And Sarah, Abrahams wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abraham, to be his wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here two Queſtions are made:</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two main Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions anſwered.</note> Why <hi>Sarah</hi> would not rather make choice of ſome free-woman, to give unto her husband, then a bond-woman?</p>
            <p>And it is anſwered, That by giving him a bond-woman, ſhe was ſure, that the children that ſhe ſhould bear, ſhould be accounted her own; for, as her miſtreſs, they belonged unto her: Whereas ſhe had failed of this, if the party had been a free-woman: for ſhe would not have yeelded her right unto another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is demanded, How <hi>Hagar</hi> is ſaid to be given to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to wife, when <hi>Sarah</hi> was his wife already? What kinde of wife was <hi>Hagar?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Patriarchs, in the Old Teſtament, had two ſorts of wives;<note place="margin">Two ſorts of wives among the Patriarchs.</note> primary, and ſecundary: both of them were reputed lawful and true wives, and therefore the children of both were accounted legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.</p>
            <p>The former wives were called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, primary wives: ſome ſay, (as I told you, not long ſince) from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is to <hi>forget;</hi> either becauſe the memory of the woman is not ſo ſtrong as the mans; or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41147:31"/> rather, becauſe the fathers family is forgotten, and in a manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, in their daughters, when they are married. And it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying of the Hebrews, <hi>Familia matris, non vocatur familia;</hi> that the mothers family, is not called the family. And for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary reaſon, a male-childe is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from memory; becauſe the memory of the father is preſerved in the ſon;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.18.</note> according to that ſpeech of <hi>Abſalon,</hi> 2 Sam. 18. <hi>I have no ſon, to keep my name in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi> And the<note n="*" place="margin">Euripides.</note> heathen man could ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: that males are the pillars of the houſe.</p>
            <p>The other ſort of wives, they call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſecundary wives,</hi> or half-wives; from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>dividere,</hi> to divide; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>uxor,</hi> a wife: as one would ſay, <hi>Uxor diviſa &amp; dimidia;</hi> a divided or half wife. The Engliſh tranſlateth them <hi>concubines;</hi> and not unfitly: for ſometimes the Hebrew word it ſelf ſignifieth a ſtrumpet or harlot.</p>
            <p>The difference between theſe primary and ſecundary wives, was this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The differences of the two ſorts of wives.</note>Firſt, there was a diſparity in their authority, or houſhold-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The wife was as miſtreſs; the concubine, as an handmaid, or ſervant: ſhe had <hi>jus tori,</hi> a right to the marriage-bed, as the chief wife had; otherwiſe, ſhe was in all reſpects inferiour; as appeareth in this ſtory of <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar: Sarah</hi> diſpoſeth of her to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> telleth his wife, that ſhe <hi>is in her hand,</hi> to do to her as it pleaſeth her; and ſhe correcteth her: and the Angel, meeting with her when ſhe was fled, chargeth her to <hi>return, and to ſubmit her ſelf to her miſtreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the betrothing of theſe wives was different. The chief wife, at her eſpouſals, received from her husband certain gifts and tokens, as pledges and teſtimonies of the Contract. Thus <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſteward gave, in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s name, unto <hi>Rebekah, jewels of ſilver, and of gold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 24.53.</note> 
               <hi>and raiment,</hi> Gen. 24. This cuſtom alſo was in uſe among the Grecians, who called thoſe gifts <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>dona ſponſalia,</hi> nuptial-tokens, (ſaith <hi>Suidas:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Suidas.</note>) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: gifts which the bridegroom preſented to his bride.</p>
            <p>Again: the chief wife received from her husband a Bill of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or matrimonial Letters: whereas, the concubine received nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch gifts, nor ſuch Letters.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, onely the children of the chief wife ſucceeded the father in his inheritance: the children of the concubine received onely gifts or Legacies. <hi>Abraham</hi> gave his inheritance unto <hi>Iſaac:</hi> unto the ſons of the concubines he gave gifts, and ſent them away from <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſon,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.5, 6.</note> while he yet lived, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. Neither did it hinder, though the concubine brought forth before the chief wife; as we ſee here, in <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar;</hi> and afterward, in the caſe of <hi>Rachel,</hi> and <hi>Bilhah</hi> her maid,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. the children of the chief wife, though later born, were preferred before the children of the concubines. And let this be ſufficient for the ſatisfaction of the Queſtions.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:41147:31"/>
            <p>Now we come to <hi>Sarahs</hi> fact.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sarah, Abrahams wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abraham to wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the knitting of the knot; and here we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>How ſin goeth on by degrees:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>1.</hi> Of Polygamy, or the divers wives of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs; how far excuſable, and why not imitable</note> And</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>How one degree is worſe then another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She had, before, onely had this device in her head, out of a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſtruſt of having any children her ſelf: then, ſhe reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth upon the putting it in practice: then, ſhe communicateth it to her husband; and ſeeing him taken with it, haſteth to perfect it.<note place="margin">The firſt Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation's twofold</note> Sin is firſt <hi>in ſemine,</hi> in the ſeed; then it is in the blade; then it cometh to an ear, and ſo to maturity: It is in the root firſt, and then in the leaf, and then <hi>in ramo,</hi> in the branch; and laſtly, <hi>in fructu,</hi> in the fruit. <hi>The woman ſaw the fruit,</hi> and <hi>it was lovely to look upon:</hi> and then Satan ſuggeſteth, that it was good for the improvement of knowledge, and they ſhould <hi>be as gods, knowing good and evil:</hi> and then they reſolve to taſte it. <hi>Si bona, cur non tangi? ſi mala, cur in paradiſo?</hi> (as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> makes the woman to ſpeak:) If the fruit be good,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Bernard.</note> why not to be touched? and if bad, what doth it in paradiſe? And ſo, at laſt, they eat it. So, there was a luſtful minde in thoſe <hi>ſons of God;</hi> and this was ſtirred, by ſeeing <hi>the daughters of men to be fair:</hi> and then they proceed to take them to be their wives. So was it in the caſe of <hi>Joſephs</hi> miſtreſs, and in the brethren of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> they came, by degrees, to perfect their ſin. And ſo in <hi>David,</hi> and the enemies of <hi>Daniel:</hi> in <hi>Haman,</hi> in the high-prieſt, and divers others.<note place="margin">James 1.14, 15.</note> Saint <hi>James</hi> layeth down this, Chap. 1. 14. firſt, there is <hi>luſt;</hi> that is the ſeed: then this luſt <hi>conceiveth;</hi> and then it <hi>bringeth forth</hi> ſin; that is, in outward action.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as I obſerved, <hi>Every of theſe ſteps and degrees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>2.</hi> The ſerpentine motion of ſin, and how each ſin is worſe then other. <hi>Jerem. 4.14.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>is worſe then other.</hi> There is the ſerpents <hi>root,</hi> Iſa. 14. and out of that cometh forth a <hi>cockatrice;</hi> and that groweth to be <hi>a fiery flying ſerpent.</hi> It is very bad to have naughty thoughts: <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.26. <hi>The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Jer</hi> 4. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved. How long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee!</hi> And it is well known, how Gods dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saints are grieved with their untoward cogitations, though they come not into the eye and obſervation of the world: even in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, they call themſelves, with S. <hi>Paul, miſerable men,</hi> becauſe they are ſenſible daily, not onely of ſuch thoughts as are <hi>injectae,</hi> caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul, on a ſudden, by Satan; but ſuch alſo as be <hi>aſcendentes,</hi> (as the School diſtinguiſheth of them;) that aſcend out of their own corrupt hearts. In this reſpect it is, that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> crieth out,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note> 
               <hi>Quando? ubi innocens fui, Domine?</hi> When, Lord, or where have I been innocent?</p>
            <p>But now evil <hi>words</hi> are worſe then evil <hi>thoughts.</hi> Pro. 30. ſaith <hi>Agur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 30.32.</note> 
               <hi>If thou haſt been fooliſh in lifting up thy ſelf,</hi> (that is, in choler, and deſire of revenge:) <hi>and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41147:32"/> And again: <hi>actions</hi> of evil, are worſe then either <hi>thoughts</hi> or <hi>words,</hi> and a greater ſigne of a wicked heart; to <hi>do</hi> ill, then onely to <hi>ſpeak</hi> or <hi>think</hi> ill.<note place="margin">Iſai. 3.8.</note> 
               <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3. <hi>Jeruſalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, becauſe their tongue and their doings are againſt the Lord.</hi> The reaſon is good: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It argueth, that ſin hath got a more full dominion and ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over a man, when it cometh into the outward man, and is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in outward action, then when it reſteth in the heart. There is no man can free his heart from corruption in this life: <hi>Who can ſay, his heart is clean?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 20.9.</note> Prov. 20. no more, then he can ſay of his body.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, What man is free from ſin, in word and deed? For, <hi>In many things we ſin all,</hi> James 3.2.</p>
            <p>But yet this is eaſier then the other: a man may more eaſily keep himſelf from the outward action, then the inward cogitation. Many a man hath thoughts of luſt, yet keepeth himſelf from the act: many a man hath thoughts of revenge, yet doth not ſhed his brothers blood. And therefore the Apoſtle adviſeth, that we ſhould not let <hi>ſin raign in our mortal bodies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.12.</note> Rom. 6. and that we ſhould not make our members <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>weapons of unrighteouſneſs:</hi> though we think evil, againſt our purpoſe; yet to take heed of bringing it forth into practice.</p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon is, When a mans corruption breaketh out into action, God is more diſhonoured, and men are the more damn fied. The man <hi>himſelf</hi> is onely hurt by his ill thoughts: but when it break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out into action, <hi>men</hi> are hurt. If <hi>ill words corrupt good manners,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.33.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) why then ſurely, evil actions: And therefore Satan putteth on men, not onely to <hi>think,</hi> but to <hi>work</hi> all iniquity with greedineſs.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Application</note>1. Let our care be, to ſtop ſin in the beginning, as neer as we can; to <hi>duſh theſe children of Babylon againſt the ſtones,</hi> when they be young; to kill the cockatrice in the egge; to quench the fire while it is but a ſpark: For it is of a growing nature; and if a man give way to it, <hi>non obtinebit ut deſinat;</hi> he ſhall not conquer it into a ceſſation.</p>
            <p>Set we our ſelves even againſt evil thoughts; pray againſt them, ſtrive againſt them, diſlike them when they riſe, and lament and mourn for them: But do not tumble this ſweet bit under thy tongue; do not take delight to dwell upon ill cogitations: for then the fire kindleth further, by this complacencie; and the next thing will be, a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpeak or do: <hi>Qui minima contemnit, paulatìm decidit:</hi> he that contemneth ſmall ſins, by degrees falleth into great ones. And Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſheweth it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note> in the example of his mother, when ſhe was a maid; how ſhe came to be overcome with a love to wine, and was thereupon called, by a ſervant in the houſe, <hi>Meribibula,</hi> that is, a wine-bibber. A little rent in a garment, is apt to be wider; and a ſmall breach in the bank of a river, will ſoon be wrought to a greater latitude. Sin beginneth in thought, and proceedeth to ill ſpeeches, and worſe actions.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:41147:32"/>
            <p>Secondly, It ſhould teach us with might and main, to withſtand the perfection of ſin; though we cannot be ſo happy, as to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ill motions; yet let us keep us from evil practices, when we have ability and opportunity for the acting of them. Let us then do as <hi>David</hi> did, who having in his wantonneſs and curioſity, luſted after the water of the well of <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> yet when it was brought unto him, had that power over himſelf, that he would not drink it, but poured it out upon the ground. So though we have luſted and coveted, and had unclean thoughts and reſolutions; let us take heed of perfecting them, for this woundeth the ſoul the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and maketh the recovery more difficult. Not to have ill thoughts is (as<note n="*" place="margin">Eccumenius.</note> one ſaith;) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.e.</hi> inevitable; and therefore though they be faulty, God will be the more merciful upon our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; but when we proceed to action, and accompliſh our ill thoughts and purpoſes, <hi>voluntarium auget peccatum,</hi> deliberation heightneth the ſin: the more of the Will in it, the greater the ſin; and the more deliberately done, the harder ſatisfied: and when we are kept from the outward commiſſion of ſin, let us not thank our ſelves, for it is Gods grace that reſtraineth us; I kept thee (ſaith God to <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 20.) <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt not ſin againſt me:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 20.6.</note> Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſoul knoweth no pauſe; and therefore if God keep it not back, a man ſhall not ceaſe till he come into <hi>profundum peccatorum,</hi> into the depths of ſin, and be, with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> even dead and buried in the grave of his ſin; the <hi>Stoicks</hi> that thought the Right and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of vertue, and refrayning of evill, to be in a mans own power, did err the whole Heaven; for if God do not keep us, we ſhall fall into as fearfull precepices, as ever <hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Pharoah,</hi> or <hi>Ahab,</hi> or <hi>Judas,</hi> or <hi>Julian,</hi> did.</p>
            <p>But now for the fact of <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Abraham;</hi> a great queſtion is implyed, whether it were lawfull or no:<note place="margin">lib. 22. <hi>Contra. Manich.</hi>
               </note> And there be two extreams about it: <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the Manichee, as (appeareth in Saint <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>) doth make holy <hi>Abraham</hi> guilty: <hi>turpis &amp; nefariae libidinis,</hi> of baſe and flagrant luſt; and that being mad on iſſue, he wallowed in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs with a baſe Harlot; he doth likewiſe challenge him with infidelity, that God having promiſed him iſſue by <hi>Sarah,</hi> he would ſeek a childe by another woman:<note place="margin">A great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> But Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> there freeth him from both theſe imputations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>Abraham</hi> was not luſtfull; for he never thought of this way, till his wife did ſuggeſt it unto him, and preſs it upon him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He was not guilty of infidelity, or diſtruſt of Gods promiſe, (ſaith he;) becauſe though God had promiſed him ſeed, yet he had not made known unto him, whether he ſhould have it by <hi>Sarah,</hi> or ſome other woman;<note place="margin">Gen. 17. &amp; 18.</note> for he revealeth it unto him in the ſeventeenth and eighteenth Chapters, that he ſhould have iſſue by <hi>Sarah.</hi> The other extream is, of thoſe that wholly acquit both
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41147:33"/> 
               <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> from any fault at all in the tranſaction of this buſineſs; ſo do many of the ancients: ſome upon light grounds, others upon thoſe that are more dangerous; I will briefly ſet down ſome of their reaſons, for the excuſe of either party.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, It is ſaid in defence of <hi>Sarah,</hi> that ſhe did but uſe the right that ſhe had over her husband;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.4.</note> for the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>The husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife;</hi> to which I anſwer: <hi>That the wife hath a power and right, over the husbands body;</hi> but not to perſwade him, or urge him to uncleanneſs with an other, contrary to the laws of marriage: her power only extendeth, to the challenging of her husband to her ſelf; and he is ſo hers, that he hath not power or right, to offer his body to another. It is eaſie to abaſe the power and right that people have; as ſome parents to their children, and ſome maſters to their ſervants, and ſome in place of authority, to thoſe that be inferiours: and ſo ſhe here maketh a perverſe uſe of that power and right that God had given her, over her husbands body, in giving up her right to another; whereas ſhe might not alienate it, or transfer it upon any; a wife cannot give leave to the husband, to take another. Now for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> part, theſe reaſons are brought.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he did it not out of a luſtfull minde, but of a deſire of iſſue: But this was anſwered before. Whatſoever his end was,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41147:33"/> the means is unlawfull; and not only the meaning, but the means muſt be good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They ſay he did not do it of his own accord,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine, l. 16. de. Civ. Dei. c. 25.</note> but by the perſwaſion of his wife; and this Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> much ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon; he ſaith of him, <hi>non impleviſse voluptatem ſuam, ſed Illius; accepiſse non petiiſse, feminaſse non amaſse:</hi> that herein he fulfulled not his own, but his wives will; that he accepted, but deſired not <hi>Hagar;</hi> that he uſeth her as a Seminary, not as an <hi>Amoretta:</hi> For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he ſaith to his wife, that the maide <hi>is in her power,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Father magnifieth him, that he uſed <hi>vocore temperanter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apologies for Abraham.</note> 
               <hi>ancil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ob temperanter, nulla intemperanter;</hi> his wife temperately, his maide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediently, neither inordinately: But this will not ſatisfie; the pleaſure of his wife was not to be hearkned unto, but the will of God; I believe that <hi>Ahab</hi> himſelf would never have taken that courſe that <hi>Jezabel did,</hi> if he had been left to himſelf, for the getting of <hi>Naba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oths</hi> vineyard; but yet it was his fault, that he lets her do what ſhe pleaſe; and uſe his ſeal to what purpoſe ſhe thought fit. Surely <hi>Moſes</hi> would have circumciſed his Son, if his wife had not diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him; but he is cenſurable for gratifying her in it. Might ſin be excuſed by the perſwaſions of wife, and friend, and brother, and the like, thouſands would be guiltleſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>mos erat, ergo crimen non crat;</hi> it was a cuſtom, and therefore thought no crime.</p>
            <p>But we anſwer: Firſt, That it was no cuſtome,<note place="margin">P. Lombard.</note> though <hi>Peter Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi> and thoſe upon him, ſay, the Patriarchs ſay it was in uſe: For we read of no man before the floud that had two wives, but only <hi>Lamech,</hi> and he was of the ſtock of <hi>Cain;</hi> it was he firſt,<note place="margin">S. Jerom.</note> ſaith Saint <hi>Jerom: Qui unam coſtam primus in duas diviſit;</hi> that firſt divided one rib into two; and after the floud, not any of the holy children of <hi>Seth,</hi> till <hi>Abraham,</hi> had two wives.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If it were a good argument, that becauſe it is a cuſtome, therefore it is not ſinfull; we might wipe out many ſins, and acquit men of them, when they are cuſtomarily committed;<note place="margin">againſt Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> for cuſtome is not to be our rule, but Gods word.</p>
            <p>Why but then Fourthly, they ſay, there was no law to forbid more wives then one: therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> did not offend in taking of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I anſwer, though there was no Law written, yet there was a Law of nature, or of Creation; and that contained a flat prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of having more then one wife at once; as appeareth in that there was but one rib taken from the man, and but one woman made of that rib: and that it is ſaid of the man, <hi>he ſhall cleave to his wife,</hi> not wives: and again, <hi>they two ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> not three, or more: And therefore that ſpeech of Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> will not fit,<note place="margin">S. Ambroſe.</note> 
               <hi>in Legem non commiſit, ſed Legem praevenit.</hi> He committed nothing againſt the Law, but prevented it, living before it.</p>
            <p>And in the Fift place, the ſame Father would excuſe the fact of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41147:34"/> 
               <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.24.25. S. Ambroſe.</note> becauſe it was a myſtery; as appeareth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>quod putas peccatum, advertis eſſe myſterium?</hi> (ſaith he:) doeſt thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that to be a myſtery, which thou accounteſt to be a ſin? I anſwer, we deny not but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> maketh it an Allegory, but what then? The myſtery lyeth, not in the marriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> but in the ſervile condition of <hi>Hagar,</hi> and the caſting of her and her ſon out of the Family: that typified the ſervitude of the Law, and that carnal ordinances were to be caſt out of the Church. We do not (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) juſtifie the fault of <hi>Lot</hi> with his daughters; becauſe it ſignified ſomething. Becauſe there was a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in <hi>Hoſea</hi>'s taking <hi>a woman of fornications;</hi> is fornication juſtified? Shall we excuſe theft, becauſe the ſudden coming of Chriſt is liken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the coming of <hi>a thief in the night?</hi> Is a man licenſed to play the unrighteous ſteward, becauſe Chriſt draweth a Parable from them likewiſe?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Some ſay, that <hi>Abraham</hi> offended not in this, becauſe we finde afterward, that God promiſeth; to bleſs the childe that was born.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: It is a fallacie <hi>non cauſae;</hi> of that pretended for a cauſe, which was not the cauſe of that ſame bleſſing. God bleſſed <hi>Iſhmael</hi> for his fathers ſake; but not for the lawfulneſs of his generation. God bleſſed <hi>Jephtah,</hi> that was baſe born, and he became the ruler of the people: but this doth not juſtifie that mixture from which he ſprung.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that which is ſaid in juſtification of this fact, is, that Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy was not unlawful, and that God diſpenſed with it in thoſe times.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Polygamy of the Fathers was a fault.</note>But, as far as I perceive, this cannot be made good: For, beſides that, (as we ſhewed before) it was againſt the law of Nature; there is a parity of matrimonial right, between man and wife; each others body, in each others power.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly; Would God have that to be in families, that ſhould be the cauſe of diſcord? But ſuch is Polygamy, as we ſee in the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in that of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and in that of <hi>Elkanah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, had Polygamy been lawful, ſurely it ſhould have been permitted moſt of all in the beginning of the world, for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of mankinde: But then God did not ſuffer it; for he then ſaid, <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife:</hi> not <hi>wives,</hi> but <hi>wife;</hi> as ſpeaking of one.</p>
            <p>The Polygamy of the fathers, then, was a fault. And let not men wonder, that it ſhould never, in all that time, be reproved: For, we do not finde <hi>Lots</hi> inceſt with his two daughters, or <hi>Jacobs</hi> marriage with two ſiſters, reproved; and yet both worthy of reprehenſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is obſervable, that moſt of the Polygamiſts were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in <hi>deeds,</hi> if not in <hi>words;</hi> either by the vexation they had from their wives, or by the croſſes they had in their children.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41147:34"/>
            <p>Why but then, if it were a fault; what ſhall we think of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs that lived and died in this ſin?</p>
            <p>It is commonly ſaid, that they ſinned not againſt their conſciences, but of ignorance and infirmity, as in other things; this being not yet clearly revealed unto them; and God, in his gracious indulgence, upon their general humiliation for all their ſins, was pleaſed to paſs by this: For, who is not guilty of many ſins, that he knoweth not perfectly to be ſins? And thoſe are waſhed away, through Gods mercy, by a general repentance. <hi>Who underſtandeth his errours?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 19.12.</note> (ſaith <hi>David:) O cleanſe thou me from my ſecret ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for a word of Application:</p>
            <p>Let no man dare to imitate the Patriarchs in this: For, if it were a fault in them, it ought to be avoided, not imitated: <hi>Inſtruunt nos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Application</note> 
               <hi>&amp; docentes, &amp; errantes</hi> (ſaith the Father:) They inſtruct us, at once erring and cautioning: we ſhould be warned by their falls. It is a prophane trick, to encourage our ſelves in evil, by the errours of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, (as too many do) pleading <hi>Noahs</hi> exceſſes, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> lying, and <hi>Lots</hi> inceſt, and <hi>Davids</hi> adultery: <hi>Si David, cur non ego?</hi>

                  </gap>ndi;</hi> (ſaith that Father:) Not as examples of falling; but, if thou beeſt fallen, of ariſing.</p>
            <p>Again, for this particular that we have diſcourſed upon, much may be ſaid, to extenuate the fault of the Patriarchs. We cannot plead, if we do offend in the like kinde: Why?<note place="margin">Matth. 19.8. Mark 10.</note> Becauſe our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord hath perfectly cleared the caſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. and <hi>Mark</hi> 10. <hi>ab initio non fuit ſic: From the beginning it was not ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>every man muſt have his own wife, and every woman muſt have her own husband,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.2. 1 Tim. 3.2.</note> 
               <hi>a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop muſt be unreprovable, the husband of one wife:</hi> ſo that he is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that hath two wives; that is, together: for it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>de Polygamia ſimultanea,</hi> of many wives at the ſame time; not of Polygamy which is <hi>ſucceſsiva,</hi> divers wives one after another: for it is not forbidden for a man to have one wife after another. Why then beware of this rock; and let us know, If, after ſuch light, we run our ſelves upon it, our fault is far greater then that of the Patriarchs; for we have a Sun, to their Candle: and, the greater light, the more perfectly ſhould our ſteps be ordered.</p>
            <p>Well, by that which hath been ſaid, we ſee, that both <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> failed in this buſineſs. We will not be ſo wicked, and foul-mouthed, to charge <hi>Abraham</hi> with groſs luſtfulneſs, and laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousneſs or make <hi>Sarah</hi> a bawd unto him:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note> Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> might ſay it truly of the Patriarchs; <hi>Caſtiùs utebantur pluribus, quàm nunc unâ:</hi> that they did more chaſtly uſe many, then many now uſe one; but on the other ſide, we muſt needs note the infirmity of theſe holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41147:35"/> and yet that rayling Fryer <hi>Fevardentius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fevardentius.</note> taxeth this in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Calvin;</hi> he taketh no knowledg what that holy man hath ſaid, indeed as much as can be ſaid, to extenuate the fault of this matrone: but becauſe he cannot acquit her of errour, he ſticketh not to ſay, that <hi>Saram multis vexat contumeliis;</hi>

               </note> that be aſperſeth <hi>Sarah</hi> with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reproaches; yea belyeth him in that manner, that he maketh him ſay: <hi>Saram voluiſſe domo ſua erigere lupanar, Et mariti Laenam eſſe:</hi> that <hi>Sarah</hi> would ſet up a Brothel-houſe in her own, and became vitiatour of her husband: But let him bark as long as he will, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor all the world can acquit <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> of a fault in this matter: Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> that had ſaid as much for <hi>Abraham,</hi> as poſſible he could, yet maketh this fact a fault; and therefore he fell into it, <hi>ut cognoſcas non ſuperioris cujuſdam naturae &amp; ſubſtantiae ſuiſſe, ſed è numero &amp; fragilitate univerſorum hominum:</hi> that thou mayeſt know, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not of any ſuperiour nature, or Angelical ſubſtance; but one of the frail number of mankinde.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>3.</hi> The deareſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God have their defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: but yet with difference enough from thoſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</note>And here we may ſee, <hi>That even the deareſt Saints of God have their failings:</hi> even after they are called into the ſtate of grace, they may be overtaken with errours.</p>
            <p>Let us turn us unto any of the Saints (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh) and we ſhall finde this made good. Righteous <hi>Noah</hi> was overcome with exceſs and inceſtuouſneſs: <hi>Jacob</hi> diſſembled, by the perſwaſion of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and <hi>Judah,</hi> his ſon, polluted himſelf with <hi>Tamar:</hi> and <hi>Reuben</hi> climbed up to his fathers bed: and <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> how cruel were they againſt the Sichemites! <hi>Moſes</hi> was diffident at the <hi>waters of ſtrife;</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> murmure againſt their brother: beſides that, <hi>Aaron</hi> was engaged in the buſineſs of the golden calf: And we know how <hi>David</hi> failed groſsly; and ſo did his ſon <hi>Solomon;</hi> ſo did <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and ſo did <hi>Jonah;</hi> and ſo did the Apoſtles of our Lord; yea, even he that ſome would have to be the chief, by his being ſhaken with the blaſt of a damſels mouth, plainly diſcovered, he could not be the Rock of the Church: yea, after this, he <hi>halted between the Jews and the Gentiles, and drew many after him in his diſsimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> I know no Saint that ever was in the world, that had not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain in this kinde.</p>
            <p>Now whence cometh this, that Gods people are ſo ſubject to failings?</p>
            <p>Certainly, Firſt, Satan is moſt ſpitefully bent againſt them; and he deſireth, eſpecially, <hi>to winnow</hi> them <hi>as wheat;</hi> and doth more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the folling of them, then in an hundred others: he ſeeketh to impair their comfort, and to bring a blemiſh upon that Truth which they profeſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the beſt have corruption in them, and carry about with them <hi>a body of ſin:</hi> though they be wholly juſtified, yet they are not wholly ſanctified: perfect ſanctification is reſerved for another life: and here, corruption will be ſtill working.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:41147:35"/>
            <p>Thirdly, the Lord in his wiſdom ſuffereth it to be thus</p>
            <p n="1">1. To abate their natural pride, by letting them have a ſenſe of their own infirmities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make them cleave more cloſely unto him. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. To make them more compaſſionate toward their brethren, in their weakneſſes; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to ſet them in joynt (as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth) with a more eaſie hand, as a man would do a member that is diſlocated.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>It confuteth the opinions of thoſe mad brains that think it is poſſible for men to be without ſin: yea,<note place="margin">Application</note> the Antinomians have not ſtuck to ſay, <hi>Be in Chriſt, and ſin if thou canſt.</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> then muſt be a lyer, who calleth that man lyer, and ſaith <hi>the truth of God is not in him,</hi> that ſaith he hath <hi>no ſin.</hi> And Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> told that Cathariſt that ſaid he had no ſin, that that very word made him a ſinner. But ſuch mad ones have more need of a Phyſitian to purge them, then of a Divine to confute them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is ground of comfort unto thoſe that mourn daily under their defects: it is none otherwiſe with them, then with the deareſt Saints: if they would weep their eyes out, they cannot weep themſelves free from ſin: nay, let them this day have repented never ſo ſeriouſly; by to-morrow, yea (God knoweth) long before to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, they ſhall be overtaken again.</p>
            <p>And as I deſire this may comfort the diſconſolate ſpirit; ſo I would be loath it ſhould encourage the prophane: for they are apt to bolſter themſelves in their groſs cuſtomable ſins, by ſaying, <hi>Every one hath his faults; we have all our infirmities.</hi> But let them know, there is a great and broad difference between their ſins, and the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that Gods children are chargeable withal.</p>
            <p>Firſt: <hi>What I hate, that I do,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom 7.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.15.</note> The children of God are convinced in their judgements, that it is a ſin; and hate it. The wicked man cannot ſay ſo: for he loveth his ſin, he huggeth this <hi>Dalilah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, at verſ. 19. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That which I would not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 19.</note> 
               <hi>that I do.</hi> The purpoſe, will, and reſolution of the children of God, is againſt ſin. So cannot the wicked ſay of himſelf; for he purpoſely and deliberately ſinneth: He doth not <hi>ſuccumbere ſomno,</hi> but <hi>vacare;</hi> he doth not nod againſt his will, but purpoſely ſetteth himſelf to ſleep.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth himſelf (verſ. 24.) <hi>miſerable man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 24.</note> in regard of his ſin: The good man is much troubled and grieved, when he is overtaken; it is a great burthen to his ſoul, and he reſteth not, until he have made his peace. It is not ſo with the wicked.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; the good man walketh not <hi>after the fleſh;</hi> he doth not make ſin a trade: but the wicked man doth; it is his daily walk. See then, whether there be not much difference between the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41147:36"/> of Gods children, and the irregularities of the wicked: and therefore little reaſon to comfort themſelves in this, That all have their failings.</p>
            <p>Laſtly: As I would be loath <hi>the dogs</hi> ſhould ſnatch <hi>the childrens bread:</hi> ſo I would be as loath, that the children ſhould play the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons with their bread; that becauſe they perſwade themſelves they are in the ſtate of grace, to ſlight ſin, and to be padling in thoſe dirty kennels; yea, to adventure upon ſome groſſer ones, that are ſweet and gainful: This is a piece of the devils Logick; <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down.</hi> Oh what horrible ingratitude is this! Is he merciful, that thou ſhouldſt be ſinful? Shall the kindneſs of the father, or maſter, make the ſon or ſervant more looſe? <hi>Joſeph</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth, from his maſters favour, to faithfulneſs: wilt thou reaſon, from Gods mercy, to iniquity? Why, the Pſalmiſt telleth thee, <hi>There is mercy with the Lord; that he may be feared.</hi> Mayeſt not thou ſuſpect thy ſelf, that thou haſt deluded thy ſelf with a vain hope that thou wert in the ſtate of grace? For certainly, no gracious heart can reaſon thus: <hi>God hath called me by his grace; therefore I will ſin, and will take the liberty to offend God.</hi> But if thou beeſt under grace, then be aſſured, that this thine argumentation will, after a while, ſpoil thy peace, and bring thee into ſuch anxieties and perplexities, before thou recover thy former feelings of Gods love, that thou wilt ſay, thou haſt had an hard penyworth of thy ſin. Remember but <hi>David,</hi> how his bones were <hi>broken,</hi> before he was reſtored in the fear of God. Let the ſenſe of Gods warm favours melt us into all poſſible obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and the neerer he hath brought us to himſelf, and the more he hath manifeſted himſelf unto us, the more obſervant let us be of him, and the more tender and fearful to do the leaſt thing that may offend him: this will ſhew <hi>the love of God</hi> to be <hi>ſhed abroad in our hearts:</hi> And that love which maketh us here holy, will make us hereafter happie.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here remaineth one thing of the former verſe; and that is, the circumſtance of time, when this plot, of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> marrying of <hi>Hagar,</hi> was put in practice; <hi>after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham had dwelt ten yeers in the land of Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this time is mentioned, (ſay ſome Hebrews) becauſe this was the time ſet for trial, Whether the wife was like to be barren or fruitful.

               </gap>: how long the Patriarch waited, how many yeers he ſtoutly bare out his unfruitfulneſs, and how, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above all paſſion, he declared his great continence and wiſdom: notwithſtanding his wives barrenneſs, never thought of having chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by any other then his wife.</p>
            <p>But ſurely, this circumſtance of time having reference to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> it ſheweth thus much, That <hi>Abraham</hi> having now continued ten yeers in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and having had a promiſe of ſeed, and no appearance of it in all this time; at the end of ten yeers, <hi>Sarah</hi> bethinks her ſelf of this project: and herein, diſcovereth,</p>
            <p>Firſt, her Impatience: ſhe was weary of waiting any longer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, her Diffidence: ſhe diſtruſted that any iſſue ſhould come by her. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, her attempting of an unlawful courſe.</p>
            <p>And theſe three are uſually linked together:<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>1.</hi> Impatient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means are Satans three fold cord, and go commonly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> that people of Iſrael while they were in the wilderneſs, often murmured and were diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, for this and that which they wanted, and grew ſo impatient, that they do not onely fly upon <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but they diſtruſt God, they queſtion his preſence; is the Lord amongſt us? and his power; can God prepare a table in the wilderneſs?

Yea thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> while God deferred the accompliſhment of his promiſe; and that <hi>Saul</hi> ſtill hunted him (as he ſaith) <hi>like a partridg upon the mountains:</hi> he groweth impatient in his ſpirit, and that worketh to a diffidence; for he ſaith, <hi>all men are lyers;</hi> and that which they have ſaid unto him, hath been but to gull and delude him; nay his thoughts bubble up againſt God, as if he had forgotten to be gracious; and he flatly ſaith, <hi>I ſhall one day fall by the hand of Saul;</hi> and what followeth upon this, but a deſperate act, he caſteth himſelf amongſt the <hi>Philiſtins;</hi> which if God had not been the more merciful, had been the next means of his confuſion. This we ſee in <hi>Job,</hi> when the hand of God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heavy upon him, and that not only his body was pained, but his minde was afflicted, he groweth impatient, and is weary of bemoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelf; and then he groweth diſtruſtfull <hi>He cryeth</hi> (as he ſaith,) <hi>but God heareth not,</hi>

               <hi>he ſtandeth up, and God regardeth not:</hi> Job. 30. And he ſticketh not to think, yea to ſay, <hi>that God hath a purpoſe to make an end of him;</hi>

To let us know, that the beſt graces in Gods children while they are cloathed with fleſh, are mingled with imperfection.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, that in thoſe infirmities which eſcape us under ſome tedious and piercing afflictions; (ſo we ſee them, and ſtrive againſt them, and be grieved for them as he was,) God will be merciful unto us. In experience we finde how ordinary it is, when men have long waited for deliverance from this or that croſs, or long ſought this or that bleſſing; they grow impatient and tumultuous in their thoughts; and from that they come to diffidence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt,<note place="margin">2 King. 6.33.</note> and ſay with <hi>Iehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 6. <hi>Why ſhould</hi> we <hi>wait on God any longer?</hi> Either they diſtruſt his power, that he cannot help; or his goodneſs, that he will not help; and then followeth, by the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of Satan, and their own corrupt hearts, an uſing of unlawful means and courſes,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.</note> to ſatisfie themſelves: Some men like <hi>Saul,</hi> run to the witch at endor, becauſe God anſwereth him not; and ſome mens diffidence groweth as ſower as deſpaire, and they caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of this life, into an eternal death.</p>
            <p>Now for the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Labour we to ſtop this courſe in the head; and whenſoever God exerciſeth us, or how long ſoever, let us poſſeſs our ſouls in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now I do not make patience to be an inſenſibleneſs under

            <p>Secondly, Out of a ſence, of our own deſerts by ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Out of a perſwaſion of that comfortable iſſue, hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the cloſe, that God will give to our tryall, if we can depend upon him. This, I ſay, we muſt labour for: and though the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our patience belong, yet we muſt not give out: <hi>Sarah</hi> here wayted ten years; I confeſs, many of us would have been ſooner weary: but if God ſhould not anſwer us in twelve years; ſo long had the woman been troubled <hi>with a bloody iſſue, Luke</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Luk. 8.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Another thing; I obſerved from this circumſtance of time in this ten years that <hi>Abraham</hi> had dwelt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> God had bleſſed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41147:38"/> him with a great eſtate; he had given him favour, in the eyes of the greateſt inhabitants of the land, and they were confederate with him; he had gotten a notable victory over certain Kings, which much raiſed the rate of him, in the opinion of the world: and God had appeared unto him, and given him great encouragement; and yet his wife was barren; he hath <hi>no childe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>2.</hi> Gods admirable diſpenſations, that while be furniſheth his children, ſtill keeps them ſhort in ſomething.</note>Thus is God pleaſed to diſpenſe his bleſſings, that <hi>he keepeth people ſhort in ſomething:</hi> though they have much, they have not all they would have.</p>
            <p>The ſon of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> hath a great eſtate, and a good and a beautiful wife: but ſhe is barren twenty yeers together. <hi>Rachel</hi> is beautiful, and beloved of her husband: but yet ſhe hath not a childe. And ſo it was with <hi>Hannah;</hi> ſhe hath her husbands heart: but God hath ſhut up her womb.<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.1.</note> So we ſee in <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian, 2 Kings 5. he <hi>was the captain of the hoſt of the king of Syria, a great man with his maſter, and honourable; a mighty man in valour,</hi> and had gotten victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: <hi>but he was a leper. Aſa</hi> was a great Prince, and had a proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous raign:<note place="margin">2 Chron. 16.</note> yet he was <hi>diſeaſed in his feet,</hi> 2 Chron. 16.</p>
            <p>And we ſee this in experience: God giveth ſome man a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; but he wanteth honour, (and, it may be, he is happier in the want of it, if he could ſee it:) yet he wanteth it, becauſe he earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſireth it. Another man hath Honour and Wealth; but he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Health; and envieth the poor labouring-mans good ſtomack. Another hath all three, and yet wanteth children; and, it may be, is diſtreſſed more how to diſpoſe of his eſtate, then ever he was to get it. Yea, many have Children alſo; but they want comfort in them: and they are beaten, oft, with that which ſhould be the ſtaff of their age. Many a man is comely and proportionable; but he wants an inſide, and hath <hi>animam pro ſale,</hi> his ſoul onely as ſalt, to keep his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſweet. Many are of excellent abilities: but they are deformed, and lack the ſymmetry of parts.<note place="margin">Gods admirable dispenſations.</note> Some man hath a good Invention; but he wanteth Judgement: and ſome have both, in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but want Memory.

               </gap>, a circle of all Learning: but they are <hi>condi,</hi> but not <hi>promi;</hi> as it were ciſterns, and not conduit-pipes: they have not the faculty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating themſelves; you muſt pump hard, to get any thing out of them. And ſome great learned Miniſters, are poor Preachers: or, if they be good at the Doctrinal part, they are not ſo good at Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p>And as God doth juſtly in all this; (for he may do what he will with his own:) ſo moſt wiſely: for ſuch is our corruption, and ſo much fleſh is in us, that if we ſhould have what we deſire, in theſe outward things, we ſhould neither know God, nor our ſelves, as we ought:<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.6.</note> 
               <hi>God is not in all the thoughts</hi> of him that <hi>ſaith in his heart, I ſhall never be removed,</hi> and <hi>feareth not adverſity:</hi> Nay, ſuch people ſay

               <note place="margin">Job. 21.14.</note> 
               <hi>we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways:</hi> and they forget themſelves even to be men; as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we ſhould be ſo in love with this life, that we would never deſire a better; we would ſay, as <hi>Peter</hi> in the mount, <hi>Bonum eſt eſſe hic; 'Tis good for us to be here:</hi> We would chuſe to have our <hi>portion in this life;</hi> and to be <hi>filii hujus ſeculi,</hi> children of this world. For, take a man that hath the affluence of all theſe outward things; that hath health, and wealth, and friends, and children, and a fair dwelling; and bathes himſelf in his pleaſures, and wanteth none outward accommodation: and how infrequent and cold are his thoughts and deſires of the life to come! how loath is he to part with This! <hi>Haec ſunt quae faciunt invitos mori:</hi> theſe are the things which occaſion an unwillingneſs to die. He is almoſt of that Cardinals minde, that preferred his part in <hi>Paris,</hi> before his part in paradiſe. Therefore, I ſay, God, in great wiſedom, keepeth us ſhort in ſome things, that we may not <hi>cor apponere,</hi> ſet our hearts upon theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral contentments.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe then:</p>
            <p>Let us be content to want ſome things that our hearts ſtand unto:<note place="margin">Application</note> We cannot ſay, we are thankful for what we have, if we murmure for what we want; if the want of one bleſſing, makes us over-look all the reſt: As we ſee in <hi>Ahab,</hi> who prized not a Kingdom, becauſe he wanted a poor Vineyard: and <hi>Haman,</hi> that took comfort in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe he wanted <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s knee. Yea, it was <hi>Abrahams</hi> infirmity, when he ſaith to God, <hi>What canſt thou give me, ſince I go childleſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if we have many things that others want; why ſhould we not be content to want ſome things that others have?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, with all our wrangling, we cannot have the thing we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; we cannot <hi>make an hair white or black:</hi> no man can receive any thing, but <hi>from above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, God thinks fit, that we ſhould, as <hi>abound</hi> in ſome things, ſo <hi>want</hi> others. <hi>Si non fit quod petitur, non expedit ut fiat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note> (ſaith the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:) if it be not granted which thou prayeſt for, God ſeeth it not expedient for thee.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let us prepare our ſelves for heaven, and, by a meek and holy carriage, fit our ſelves for it: and in that place there ſhall be no want; it ſhall give every one ſatisfaction: though the veſſels caſt into the vaſt ocean may be of different, capacity, and ſo, degrees of glory; yet the leaſt veſſel ſhall be as full as it can hold: and whereas here, (as the School-men acutely) <hi>quieſcimus in deſideriis,</hi> we are fain to be contented with deſires of reſt: there, ſhall be <hi>deſideriorum quies;</hi> an abſolute and bleſſed reſt of all deſires.</p>

            <p>And are not we able to ſeal to this in our own experience?

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sol.</note>It may be ſo in the outward man, which God, in his wiſdom, may ſuffer; as we ſee in the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were twice diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> and overthrown with a great ſlaughter, (though, both times, God commanded them to go out) for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their patience, and puniſhment of their ſins, to move them to ſervent humiliation and invocation.

            <p>I renew then my Exhortation: Let us not look for comfort in any buſineſs, wherein we do not ask Gods counſel, be our helps and means as probable and likely as may be. Let us look, <hi>non confirmari, ſed infirmari,</hi> (as one ſaith:) not to be ſtrengthened unto the end, but weakned therewith: expect God to croſs us, to give us mourning, in ſtead of all the mirth we looked for; penury, in ſtead of plenty; ignominy, in ſtead of dignity; contempt, in ſtead of comfort: as we ſee here in <hi>Sarah,</hi> whoſe plot is paid home, with the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41147:43"/> and pride of her ſervant, that ſhe had preferred to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Which are two things further that we are to conſider of, as thoſe which did edge her expoſtulation with her husband.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ingratitude of her maide I told you of the laſt day,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>2.</hi> The ill offices of a friend, still wound the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</note> how ill it was in <hi>Hagar:</hi> now let me tell you, how deep it cut her miſtreſs: that ſhe, whom ſhe had loved and dignified, ſhould be thus malepert againſt her; and certainly, ingratitude after good and great deſervings, will affect much: <hi>Joſeph</hi> thought with himſelf, how ill his maſter muſt take it from him; that he, whom he had ſo reſpected and advanced, ſhould wrong his bed: we know what <hi>David</hi> had done for <hi>Keilah;</hi> he had ſaved it from the Philiſtims; thoſe ingrateful ones, for all that, had a purpoſe to deliver him into <hi>Sauls</hi> hand; it much troubleth him, inſomuch that he asketh God, once, and the ſecond time; <hi>will the men of Keilah deliver me?</hi> Can they be ſo unthankful for a benefit ſo freſh in their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. <hi>David</hi> knew well what he had done for <hi>Nabal,</hi>

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; what, thou my ſon! a cold winde from the South is moſt unnatural; and unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from thoſe that we have moſt favoured, is intolerable.</p>
            <p>Now for the Uſe of it:</p>
            <p>Becauſe we may be exerciſed with this trial among others,<note place="margin">Application</note> and that we may finde people ungrateful unto us; and thoſe moſt, of whom we have deſerved beſt; and becauſe, it is a thing apt to work upon us, and diſturb us; let us fortifie our ſelves againſt it, by theſe things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let us conſider the vitiouſneſs and depravedneſs of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as there is in man a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſeed-plot and ſeminary of all ſin; and among the reſt, he is apt to be guilty of ingratitude; we ſhould therefore wonder no more at this then at other ſins; for the fire will burn, and the fountain will bubble up, and corrupt Nature will ſhew it ſelf; every thing will doe according to its kinde.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:41147:44"/>
            <p>Secondly, to pacifie us, let us know we are not alone in this; in all times men have had experience of others unthankfulneſs. <hi>Moſes</hi> from the people, to whom he did ſo many good offices; the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſoon forgot <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who, when time was, was only, under God, the preſerver of their Country: Iſrael ſhewed not kindeneſs to <hi>Gideon according to all the goodneſs that he had ſhewed to Iſrael;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 8.10.</note> Judg. 8. our Lord ſuffered in this kinde from the Jews, yea from <hi>Judas</hi> his own Diſciple; and who are we, that we ſhould be exempted from this tryal?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let us think often of our carriage towards God, how he hath heaped up bleſſings upon us; yea, tyled one favour upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, day by day, <hi>every morning,</hi> his mercies are renewed; he doth not only prevent us with them, and follow us with them; but even compaſſeth us with them: we are as a Center, wherein the lines of his bleſſings from every part of the Circumference, do meet: and yet how unthankful are we! every day provoking him, every moment ſinning againſt him; as if we would out-vie his mercies, with our ſins: as if like the <hi>Sycamour</hi> tree, we were the more barren for the oftner watering; it ſhould leſs trouble us therefore, when men are unthankful unto us, when we conſider the meaſure we offer to God; nay, we ſhould take it as a juſt puniſhment of our ingratitude towards him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we ſhould not do good turns to others for thanks, or to oblieg them unto us; but we ſhould do, what we do, ingenuouſly, out of a conſcience of Gods commandment; that tyeth us to do good offices to them, out of a ſence of our brothers neceſſities; or out of a feeling of what true friendſhip and charity requireth of us: For when we aym at thanks, in the collation of favours, and think to binde men unto us, it more affecteth us when they prove unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the beſt way is to leave ſuch perſons to God, who is a ſure pay-maſter to thoſe that are guilty of this moral defect, this breach of good manners; in experience, he hath ſeldom ſuffered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, even in men towards men, to go unpuniſhed; now if God will revenge it, why ſhould we afflict our ſelves with it? <hi>Idoneus Sequeſter,</hi>

               <hi>Is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi> in this caſe:) He wil remember it, when we have forgotten it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond thing that edgeth <hi>Sarah,</hi> is, contempt and diſdain, that ſhe findeth of her ſelf,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>3.</hi> Contempt is the heavieſt burden to ingenious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt it.</note> in her ſervant; ſhe was deſpiſed in her eyes: and it cannot be denyed but that was a ſhrewd temptation; it was not ſo much by far, to be unthankful, as to add ſcorn unto it: the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous nature of man doth doubtfully conflict with this; and it can brook any thing rather then contempt: above hell there is not a greater puniſhment, then to become a <hi>Sannio,</hi> a ſubject of ſcorn: <hi>Samſon</hi> more patiently endureth the boring out of his eyes, then the Iudibrious ſcoffs of the Philiſtims: the inſultation of her colleague,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41147:44"/> was that which vexed the ſoul of <hi>Hannah; David</hi> bemoaneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, Pſal. 69. <hi>Thou haſt known my reproaah, and my ſhame,</hi>

            <p>For the Uſe of it:</p>
            <p>This may befal us, (who had rather ſuffer a blow then a jeer,<note place="margin">Application</note> a wound then a word of diſgrace;) and therefore we muſt arm our ſelves againſt it, by conſidering,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that others, and thoſe dear Saints of God, have ſuffered the like; how was <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſcorned by his bretheren? they ſtile him, in contempt, the dreamer; and how was <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed by the people? <hi>as for this Moſes, we know not what is become of him;</hi>

               </gap>; in way of contempt, and contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and ſo we ſee how <hi>Job</hi> was deſpiſed when he was down the weather; yea, even by thoſe, whom, when he proſpered, <hi>he would ſcarce have ſet with the dogs of his flock:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was fully exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in this kinde, <hi>the very abjects deſpiſed him, and the drunkards made Songs of him:</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> complaineth, Chapter 20.<note place="margin">Jer. 20.7.</note> 
               <hi>J am in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion daily, and every one mocketh me:</hi> how was our bleſſed Saviour <hi>deſpiſed, and rejected of men!</hi> as it was propheſied, Iſa. 53. they vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in his life, and gave him baſe language; he was <hi>a ſinner</hi> (in their mouthes) <hi>a friend of publicans and ſinners;</hi> he was <hi>a Samaritan, and had a divel:</hi> and in his death, he that was <hi>Clarus imperio,</hi> was <hi>plenus opprobrio,</hi> (as the Father ſpeaks,) he that was bright in Majeſty, was ful of ignominy; he was undervalued to a wicked murtherer, he ſuffered between two theeves; and when he was upon the Croſs, one of them reviled him: and thoſe that paſſed by flouted him, and wagged their heads ſaying, <hi>Thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it up in three dayes, ſave thy ſelf;</hi> how were the Apoſtles contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? thought to be <hi>full of new wine;</hi> and ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> amongſt the reſt, diſparaged as a babler by the Athenians, as a peſtilent fellow, by <hi>Tertullus,</hi> as a mad man by <hi>Feſtus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why then, let not contempt and ſcorn afflict us too much, ſeeing we have ſuch partners in it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to ſtay us, let us conſider of Gods hand in it; we ſuffer <hi>according to the will of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.10.</note> and <hi>David</hi> ſtayed himſelf with this, that <hi>God bid Shimei</hi> rail, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. God hath many rods, to

            <p n="2">2. God doth it for good ends:</p>
            <p>Firſt, to exerciſe our patience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to keep us from ſeeking the praiſes of men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to aſſure us that we are in the right way that other of his ſervants have been in: for they have gone thorow <hi>good report, and bad report,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.8.</note> 2 Cor. 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third thing that I preſcribe, for the better bearing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, is, to labour the ſubduing of that pride which is in our hearts: for, becauſe we think too well of our ſelves, and have an over-ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our own parts, we are impatient of the leaſt ſcorn. <hi>Haman</hi> was a proud man, and therefore it brake his heart, almoſt, to finde diſreſpect but from one poor Jew. The Phariſees were proud, and highly conceited of themſelves; and therefore we ſee how they ſcorn the man that had been blinde, and think themſelves diſparaged that he ſhould teach them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 We ſhould be often in the meditation of our ſins: for when a man ſeriouſly conſidereth of them, and groaneth under them, he maketh nothing of mens taunts and reproaches. When Sin lieth heavie, Contempt lieth light: but where ſin lieth light, every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful paſſage is a burden.<note place="margin">Pſal. 38.</note> David ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. being exerciſed with a ſight of his ſin, when his enemies did vent their ſcorn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches againſt him, he was as a man that <hi>heard not, and in whoſe mouth were no reproofs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, let us ſeek, in all things, <hi>to approve our ſelves to God,</hi> and then we ſhall be able to ſay, with Saint <hi>Paul, I paſs not to be judged of you,</hi>

               <hi>Doſt thou now govern the kingdom of Iſrael?</hi> As if ſhe ſhould have ſaid, I am aſhamed that thou ſhouldſt be called a King, that art of ſo poor a ſpirit, to afflict thy ſelf for the denial of that which thou mayeſt command: if thou canſt not have it by fair means, extort it by force. She doth upbraid him with puſillanimity. And as bitter a ſpeech was that of <hi>Jobs</hi> wife to her husband, <hi>Job</hi> 2.9. <hi>Doſt thou ſtill retain thine integrity?</hi> Art thou ſo vain, to ſerve that God that thus afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee? Art thou ſo in love with blowes? Much good do thee with thy Religion. She maketh him even ſenſleſs and fooliſh, that would endure ſo much, and not rid himſelf of life. And ſome ſuch wives hath the world known, (I would it did not ſtill know) that are bitter in their ſpeeches upon occaſion, that a man may judge the <hi>poiſon of aſps to be under their lips;</hi> their tongues cutting like a <hi>ſharp ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor:</hi> So ſharp is their language, that many a <hi>Xantippe</hi> putteth <hi>Socrates</hi> to the practice of his beſt Philoſophy: So ſharp, that <hi>Solomon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth them to <hi>a continual dropping,</hi> Prov. 19. Yea, he ſaith, Chap. 21.<note place="margin">Prov. 19.13.</note> 
               <hi>It is better to dwell in the wilderneſs, then with a contentious and angry wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Some men have reaſon to wiſh, either their wives quieter, or their houſes larger: (women being all Linguiſts, but ſome more nimble then others, of everlaſting motion.) Yea,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> findeth none ſo fit a reſemblance of an ill conſcience, as a ſcolding woman. God help the man that is ſo vexed; he hath his purgatory in this life: And ſome of the Hebrews had a conceit, that ſuch an one ſhould never come into Judgement, becauſe he had a ſufficient puniſhment here.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe:</p>
            <p>Let wives take heed of the waſpiſh ſtinging tongue:<note place="margin">Application</note> let them not uſe ſharp and provoking language: let them labour for that which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> maketh a chief ornament of that ſex, and to be <hi>of great price in the ſight of God;</hi> and that is, <hi>a meek and a quiet ſpirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.4.</note> Let them control their paſſions, and never ſuffer them to break out into intemperate ſpeeches, to the kindling of ſuch a fire, as God knows when it may be quenched. The Rabbins obſerve, that in the holy Tongue, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Secondly, obſerve, that as ſhe was vehement and bitter, ſo ſhe challengeth her husband unjuſtly: for how was he in fault? nay, ſhe knoweth not; ſhe hath not yet examined, whether <hi>Abraham</hi> gave any encouragement to <hi>Hagar</hi> to be thus malepert; ſhe onely ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Rachel</hi> ſpeaketh paſſionately to her husband, <hi>Give me children, or elſe I die,</hi> Gen. 30.1. as if he were in the fault that ſhe had none. He preſently let her ſee her errour: <hi>Am I in Gods ſtead,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?</hi> The wife of <hi>Potiphar</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to accuſe her husband in the preſence of her ſervants, that he had brought in an Hebrew to mock her: and ſo <hi>Zipporah</hi> challengeth her husband that he was the cauſe of that act that was ſo horrid unto her; the circumciſing of the childe. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, they layd to his charge things that he knew not; and we finde how <hi>Shimei</hi> charged him with that, that he was altogether innocent of, bloodineſs againſt the houſe of <hi>Saul:</hi> And ſo we ſee what a jealouſy the ſervants of <hi>Ammon</hi> put into his head concerning <hi>Davids</hi> Meſſengers, that they were purpoſely ſent to ſpy out the weakneſs of the land. <hi>Jeremy</hi> was challenged, to ſtand on the Chaldeans part: our bleſſed Lord was challenged for an enemy to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and ſo were his Apoſtles, falſly accuſed: and ſo were thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, that in their <hi>antelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani Coetus;</hi> their early devotions, they did practiſe a promiſcuous uncleanneſs, that they worſhipped an Aſſes head; that they did ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice their own children; all which, even <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> himſelf doth acquit them of</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of it:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Let us take heed of this precipice, of accuſing others falſly; it is the devils trade: he is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Firſt, want of wiſdom; for a wiſe man will be aſſured of the fault, before he challenge one for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, want of charity, for love will rather cover a fault, when it is known, then pick an hole where there is none.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is the next way to make one that is a friend, to be an enemy; for it is harſh to any ingenuous nature, to be challenged for that which he is not guilty of, as we ſee in <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> who challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abner</hi> for going in to his fathers concubin, (of which ſome
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41147:46"/> think he was guiltleſs; and it was only <hi>Iſhboſheths</hi> ſuſpition,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.</note>) he made him fall off from him, to the houſe of <hi>David;</hi> 2 Sam. 3.</p>
            <p>Again, we may learn here, that if jealouſies and ungrounded ſuſpitions, do work ſuch ill abroad; what will they do in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the man and wife between whom there is the ſtraiteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; when they only ſuſpect one another, and thereupon fall to challenging each other without ſure ground, oh, what a diſtraction it worketh, and how it doth ſour that ſweet eſtate of wedlock! maketh a diſorder amongſt the Children and Servants, and it may be, a ſiding; and the breach is hardly made up again! the purer the love is, and the leſs conſcious of any juſt occaſion, the more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: you may do that to a ſtone jugg, that you cannot do to a Venice glaſs; it muſt be uſed tenderly: I wiſh ever therefore that wiſdom and charity between man and wife; that they be not forward to ſuſpect evil of each other and never to proceed to challenging of each other without apparent ground; and even then with that mildneſs and moderation of ſpirit, as becometh thoſe that are ſo neer; as we ſee in <hi>Joſeph</hi> towards <hi>Mary,</hi> though but eſpouſed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you have ſeen ſhe was vehement and rough in this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge: but ſuppoſe ſhe had juſt cauſe, there had been more reaſon ſhe ſhould have charged her ſelf before her husband; for ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>

We ſee then here,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>6.</hi> Of clamourouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that it is rather a ſign of guilt, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</note> that which oftentimes falleth out in the world. They that are moſt guilty are apt firſt to complain, and cry out of injury; the miſtreſs of <hi>Joſeph</hi> that was all in the fault, yet cryeth out to her ſervants, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> would have abuſed her; and as ſoon as her husband cometh home frameth a formal accuſation againſt him: when the two He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews did contend, Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> noteth, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.27.<note place="margin">Act. 7.27.</note> that he that did the wrong to his neighbour, is the moſt clamorous, and thruſteth <hi>Moſes</hi> away, and will not endure to hear of a reconciliation; <hi>Zipporah</hi> ſharpeneth her tongue againſt her husband, and calleth him bloody, becauſe of the Circumciſion, whereas ſhe was in the fault, and the cauſe that the Angel of God met <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Inn, and would have killed him: <hi>Saul</hi> complaineth againſt <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had more juſt cauſe of complaint againſt him: <hi>Ziba</hi> that playeth the knave with his Maſter, complaineth of his Maſter:<note place="margin">Hiſt.

It is Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his ſaying, <hi>Feſtinat loqui, qui timet vinci;</hi> He maketh haſte to complain, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41147:47"/> hath the worſt end of the ſtaff: and we have known it in Domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal quarrels, that the wife hath cryed out of injury, when her ſelf hath been in the fault.<note place="margin">Application</note> And ſo on the other ſide too, let not people be of that bold front to accuſe others of that wherein they are moſt culpable; for it is a fearful thing to go againſt the light of a mans own conſcience: though they may get ſomething with men by cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, yet they offend God, and wrong their inward peace: in ſtead of quarreling, they ſhould ſay as <hi>Judah; ſhe is more righteous then I.</hi> I am to blame, and therefore I have reaſon to challenge my ſelf, rather then another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It ſhould teach thoſe, to whom belongeth the hearing, and judging of cauſes; not to be too haſty in determining them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt complaint, or to give credit to the firſt information: For, as we ſay, one tale is good, till another be heard; and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">Prov. 18.17.</note>

            <p>In the laſt part, is ſet down the birth of <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> together with the age of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was born unto him: in the two laſt verſes.</p>
            <p>We have quite diſpatched the firſt Part, which containeth the marriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Hagar;</hi> and are entred into the ſecond, which intreateth of the events of this Marriage: and two of them we have handled; <hi>Hagars</hi> conception, and inſolency upon her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving: And have in part touched the third, which is the expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sarah</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in this fifth verſe.</p>

            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>We ſhould take heed of this foul, yet frequent fault in the world;<note place="margin">Application</note> which is, When men have done kindneſs to others, to noſe them with it, and report it to others. The Wiſe-man maketh it an ill thing, to rate a man with harſh language, and then to beſtow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon him: ſuch a gift may be thought rather <hi>Injuriae ſatisfactae,</hi> then <hi>Beneficii collati:</hi> to have more of ſatisfaction for that injury, then of conferred kindneſs, in it: And ſo, after a benefit beſtowed, to upbraid him with it. Let us take heed of both: for, he that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth with ill words, gives <hi>panem lapidoſum,</hi> bread with gravel in it: and he that upbraideth afterwards, he ſpoileth his gift, and loſeth his thanks: 'Tis <hi>nimium liberalitatis, cùm exigit gratiam;</hi> more bounty then was wiſhed for, that extorteth thanks: and is far from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>James</hi> 1.<note place="margin">James 1.5.</note> that <hi>he giveth to all men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, and upbraideth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, (but will ſome ſay) may not a man, at any time, tell a man what kindneſs he hath ſhewed him, and tell others of it?</p>
            <p>Yes, if they ſhall be groſsly ungrateful, either by forgetting or ſlighting the benefit received, or by returning ill for good. As the Lord ſpeaketh much to <hi>Samuel,</hi> what he had done for <hi>Saul;</hi> and by the mouth of <hi>Nathan,</hi> what he had done for <hi>David;</hi> and by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 5.</note> what he had done for his <hi>vineyard:</hi> and Chriſt himſelf <hi>upbraideth</hi> thoſe Cities wherein he had done moſt of his miracles, becauſe they <hi>repented not,</hi> Matth. 11.<note place="margin">Matth. 11.20.</note> And thus <hi>David</hi> telleth what he had done for <hi>Nabal,</hi> when he ſaw him ſo ungrateful, that he would not gratifie him with a little of his ſuperfluity, in the time of his neceſſity, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. And <hi>Jacob</hi> telleth <hi>Laban</hi> to his face, what good offices he had done for him, when he was ſo injurious. But elſe, it is an unfitting and uncivil thing, for a man to upbraid another with the good he hath done him: he doth but put his brother to the bluſh, and even retract and make void his own benefits: And if he blowe his trumpet in the hearing of others, and tell, that this and that he hath done; it argueth rather pride and vain-glory, then true beneficence and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>One word more, of the phraſe here uſed: <hi>I gave my maid into thy boſome.</hi>

               <hi>What is the neerneſs and intimacy of the wife to the husband.</hi>

            <p>She is <hi>the wife of his boſome;</hi> ſo often called in the Scripture: <hi>Deut.</hi> 13 6. <hi>If the wife of thy boſome ſhall tempt thee.</hi> So, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.54. <hi>The wife of his boſome.</hi> By that ſheep that lay in the poor mans <hi>boſome,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.3.

I ſay, This argueth the neerneſs and intimacy of the wife to the husband: And thoſe familiar geſtures, and loving dalliances that are often uſed, are but expreſſions of it. It is ſaid, that <hi>Abimelech ſaw Iſaac ſporting with Rebekah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 26.8.</note> Gen. 26. in ſuch a familiar, yet ſober and decent manner, that it perſwaded him that ſhe was his <hi>wife,</hi> whom before he had affirmed to be his <hi>ſister:</hi> for he well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that <hi>Iſaac,</hi> being an holy man, would not have been ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with any but his wife.</p>
            <p>Now for the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Is ſhe <hi>the wife of the boſome,</hi> and his own; yea, <hi>his own fleſh?</hi> How cometh it to paſs, that many are ſo ſtrange to their wives? They can take more content in the company of others, then their own; and expreſs more mirth among ſtrangers, then with their own wives: yea, thruſt their wives from them, while they put others into their boſome. I would they would but read and meditate upon that of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 5.19, 20.</note> Prov. 5. who, ſpeaking of the wife, giveth this advice: <hi>Let her be as the loving hinde, and as the pleaſant roe: Let her breſts ſatisfie thee at all times, and be thou raviſhed always with her love.

               <hi>ſed quia ſua,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Aug.</hi>) not as they are true, but as their own. She is his; and his love and affection muſt be confirmed to her.</p>
            <p>There is, oftentimes, as great a fault in the wife towards the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: he is called <hi>the husband of her boſome</hi> alſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.56. And yet ſome women can be free and familiar with other men, with the neglect (I had almoſt ſaid contempt) of their own. <hi>Job</hi> complaineth, that his <hi>breath was ſtrange to his wife,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 19.17.</note> Chap. 19. and he was then in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, when ſhe ought moſt to have comforted him. And there be many, that, both in proſperity, and adverſity, ſet too light by their husbands.</p>
            <p>Let man and wife take heed of this ſtrangeneſs. By this phraſe, <hi>the wife of the boſome,</hi> and <hi>the husband of the boſome,</hi> is intimated their eer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſtrictneſs of affection, that ſhould be between them; that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41147:49"/> comfort, and contentment, and ſolace, that they ſhould take in each other. The boſome is the place of warmth and refreſhment; and therefore it is, (ſay ſome) that Heaven is called <hi>Abrahams boſome;</hi> in which place thoſe will hardly meet, that are ſo far from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Boſome, that they come not neer each others Bed or Board; nay, the ſame Houſe or Town will not hold them: and may we think that, living and dying on theſe terms, the ſame Heaven will hold them?</p>
            <p>To go on:</p>
            <p>She inſtanceth the carriage of her maid, and taxeth her both of Ingratitude, and Inſolency. In the laſt part of the verſe, ſhe deſireth God to <hi>judge</hi> between her and her husband: which ſome will have to be a ſimple referring of her ſelf to God; as if ſhe had ſaid, What now I ſuſtain in this paſſage, let God judge it; I refer the cauſe to him. And if ſo, ſhe ſetteth us a good example,
<q>That we ſhould not revenge our ſelves, but commit our cauſe to God.<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>3.</hi> The beſt reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſelves is, the referring of all to God.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So did <hi>Joſeph:</hi> when he was ſo hardly uſed by his brethren, that neither prayers nor tears could prevail, he yeeldeth up all to God, and ſubmitteth to the iſſue that God will give. And ſo did <hi>Moſes:</hi> when his brother and ſiſter murmured againſt him, he replieth not, nor ſeeketh any revenge againſt them; but leaveth it to God, who quickly interpoſed for him, <hi>Num.</hi> 12. Thus <hi>David,</hi>

               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 24.22. 1 Pet. 2.23.</note> (as the School calleth our Lord:) of whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. that <hi>when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not; but committeth himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>It meeteth with thoſe hot ſpirits, in theſe days,<note place="margin">Application</note> who cannot brook any injuries: They will revenge themſelves; they will not ſtay the judgement, either of God, or of his ſubſtitute, the Magiſtrate; which,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is moſt unreaſonable, that a man ſhould be Accuſer, Witneſs, Judge, and Executioner, all in his own cauſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is ſinful: for it is an uſurping of that power which belongeth unto God: for, <hi>vengeance</hi> is his, and belongeth to him, and to ſuch as he hath delegated, who <hi>carry not the ſword in vain.</hi> People are apt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41147:50"/> to think it baſe and unmanly to complain: but, in the mean time, they think not how they treſpaſs againſt God and his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is prepoſterous: for, <hi>nondum vindicatus eſt Chriſtus,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note>) Chriſt himſelf is not yet avenged on his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; and muſt they have preſent ſatisfaction?</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is very fooliſh: for they prevent themſelves in that which they would have, by their haſte: For, would they leave it to God, he would not onely avenge their cauſe, <hi>ſine perturbatione,</hi> without paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they cannot do; but <hi>acerbius vindicaret,</hi> he would revenge it more ſharply, then they can do haſtily: They cannot inflict ſo much upon the bodies of their brethren, as they do wrong their own ſouls: for while they revenge themſelves upon thoſe that have done the injury,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note> 
               <hi>duo mali,</hi> (ſaith the Father) there are two ſinners; the one offendeth in offering injury; the other, in revenging it: And all the difference (ſaith he) is, That the one getteth before, and the other followeth after unto judgement.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the fifth place, therefore, let us commit our wrongs unto God, to avenge them: The Apoſtle ſo expreſly ſaith, <hi>Avenge not your ſelves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.19.</note> Rom. 12. <hi>but rather give place unto wrath:</hi> and he alſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to whom to commit the cauſe, even to him who ſaith, <hi>Vengeance is mine,</hi> and <hi>I will repay</hi> it. <hi>Si apud illum depoſueris injuriam, ultor eſt,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note>) If thou lay down thy wrong at his feet, he will take up thy quarrel, and revenge it. Chriſt would have his diſciples <hi>buy ſwords;</hi> yet, when time came, he forbade <hi>Peter</hi> to uſe it. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> wonders at this: <hi>O Domine, gladium emerejubes, &amp; ferire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibes?</hi> Lord, commandeſt thou to buy the ſword, and yet forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou to ſtrike therewith? What may be the reaſon? <hi>niſi ut prompta ſit defenſio, &amp; non ultio;</hi> unleſs to ſhew a readineſs of defence, we may have, but not of revenge: <hi>potuiſſe vindicare, non voluiſſe;</hi> that the world might take notice, they were able to have avenged themſelves, but not willing. We muſt be patient, and leave that to God, to take vengeance. And howſoever Revenge be a very pleaſing thing to fleſh and blood; and the wicked <hi>Hamans</hi> of the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud themſelves in it; (<hi>an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a wound for a wound: &amp; ſic juvat ire per umbras:</hi> they think they ſhall have more content in their death, by this means:) yet ſuch <hi>wrath worketh not the righteouſneſs of God:</hi> and they ſhall finde, when they come before him that muſt judge all, that they have wronged their ſouls, in taking revenge.</p>
            <p>But now I muſt tell you, that ſome Expoſitors make this an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation; as if ſhe deſired God to judge him for her carriage in this buſineſs; and to puniſh him for fomenting and nouriſhing the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid in her malapertneſs and inſolency: for ſo ſhe conceived it.

               <hi>The Lord look upon you and judg, in that you have made us abhorred of Pharaoh and his ſervants; and have put a ſword into their hands to ſlay us:</hi> The mother of <hi>Micah</hi> was in ſuch a rage, for the ſilver that was taken from her, that ſhe curſed: <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.<note place="margin">Judg. 17.2. 1 Sam. 17.43.</note> Thus the uncircumciſed Philiſtins in their pride, and diſdain, and rage, curſed <hi>David:</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.

            <p>Firſt, that they are not ſo much curſes, as propheſies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they did it not in their own cauſe, but in Gods; and not <hi>ex livore invidiae;</hi> but <hi>ex Zelo juſtitiae:</hi> they did it not out of any gaul of envy, but meerly out of zeal of juſtice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that they were led by an extraordinary ſpirit, and by that ſpirit they alſo diſcovered thoſe whom they curſed to be incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.

            <p>For the Uſe then of this:</p>
            <p>It ſhould teach us to take heed of imprecations;<note place="margin">Application</note> and that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd thoſe the better, we ſhould labour to ſubdue our Paſſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for it is that which bringeth forth direful curſes: it diſcovereth it ſelf not only in looks and geſtures, but in dreadful curſes.

Yea, they deſire the confuſion of others, and whom do they ſpare? not ſervants, not children, not wives, not the brute creatures; no not their own ſouls: how commonly do people wiſh God to forſake them, to judg them, to damn them! In the fear of God, let us take heed of theſe imprecations; if God ſhould not be

If he had replied nothing, it would have more provoked his wife; it might have ſeemed a ſigne of contempt. It is obſerved of <hi>Xantippe,</hi> that vixon, the wife of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that when, upon her cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous invectiveneſs, her husband gave her not a word, it madded her the more: for ſhe interpreted it as a kinde of ſcorn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had not anſwered, it would have confirmed his wife in her unjuſt ſuſpition of him; and ſhe would have ſaid, See, he hath nothing to reply; ſelf-guiltineſs bungs up his mouth: for, were he faultleſs, why doth he not ſpeak, and purge himſelf? but he well knoweth, I have charged him with nothing but truth: he hath animated my maid to her baſe carriage towards me, and fomenteth her ſtill in her petulancy. And therefore, <hi>cùm clamat conſcientia, ſilet eloquentia:</hi> when the conſcience is clamorous, the tongue is mute. He had reaſon therefore to anſwer, that he might clear himſelf. And certainly, as, in regard of the former Reaſon, it is a fault in a man, when he ſeeth another angry, to do anything whereby he may be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41147:52"/> provoked to a further meaſure of paſſion, (though ſome take a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do it:) ſo, in regard of the ſecond, a man is not to be ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el to his own reputation, as not, by a modeſt and ſober anſwer, to wipe off the dirt that is caſt upon him. It is not enough to ſay, (as the man in <hi>Jerome) Sufficit mihi conſcientia mea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8. Jerome.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; habeo Deum judicem conſcientiae:</hi> my conſcience is ſufficient for me, and I have God the ſole judge of my conſcience: For <hi>Job</hi> had both <hi>Teſtem in coelo,</hi> (as himſelf ſaith) <hi>my witneſs is in heaven;</hi> and he had his conſcience witneſſing for him: and yet he ſtands up againſt thoſe friends of his that unjuſtly charged him, and would needs have his ſufferings to be the puniſhment of his hypocriſie. And ſo did <hi>Jeremiah</hi> open his mouth againſt his adverſaries: and ſo did <hi>Steven,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and divers others. To be innocent of a crime objected, is a great bleſſing of God; and therefore, for a man not to ſtand up in the defence of his innocency, but to ſuffer <hi>dead flyes</hi> to be caſt into his <hi>ointment,</hi> and not to caſt them out thereof, but to ſtand ſilent; he betrayeth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency; nay, he ſeemeth to deſpiſe ſo great a bleſſing: and he may, for the preſent, lie under an unjuſt diſgrace; which, to an ingenuous nature, is no little affliction; ſo he may, another day, be judged <hi>pro otioſo ſilentio,</hi> as well as <hi>pro otioſo verbo,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Ambroſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Ambroſe.</note>) for that ſame idle ſilence, as well as for other idle words. It is true, we read in Scripture, that when reproaches have been ſent out againſt holy men, they have been ſilent: but it was not out of a neglect of their credit, but out of ſome other ſwaying conſiderations, to which even credit it ſelf was to give place. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Numb. 6.12.</note> 
               <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> ſpeak againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and uſe words of diminution:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Toſtatus</hi> in loc.</note> 
               <hi>Toſtatus</hi> maketh it a queſtion, Whether <hi>Moſes</hi> were preſent to hear them, or no; and he thinks it more probable, that he was not preſent: But 'tis like enough he quickly heard of it; and yet (ſaith he) <hi>non legitur quod reſpondit;</hi> 'tis not mentioned that he anſwered. What might be the reaſon of that? Was it becauſe he took knowledge, that God had took know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, and he would leave it to him to revenge? Certain it is, that the leſs a man ſtriveth for himſelf, the ſooner God eſpouſeth his quarrel, and becometh his champion.</p>
            <p>Or, ſecondly, was there not another reaſon of it? namely, that if he ſhould have made a reply, and ſo a conteſt and altercation about it, he feared it would have been matter of rejoycing to thoſe that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved none of them all: for they did not more emulate him, then many of the people did them all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Quia Moſen in Ducem, Aaron in Sacerdotem, Miriam in Prophetiſſam, elegit Deus;</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ferus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ferus</hi> in locum.</note>) becauſe God had choſen <hi>Moſes</hi> for a Leader, <hi>Aaron</hi> for the Prieſt, and <hi>Miriam</hi> for a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs unto his people; to ſome of whom, this would have been a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, to ſee brother and ſiſter againſt brother; to ſee the Prince, and the Prieſt and Propheteſs, claſh: Therefore, rather then he would give cauſe of inſulation to malevolent and envious ſpirits, <hi>tacitus

                  <hi>Calv.</hi> in locum.</note> (as reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith;) he ſwalloweth the injury, with a patient ſilence. So we read, that when <hi>Shimei</hi> railed at <hi>David,</hi> and curſed him, he anſwered not, though he were within hearing,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was a contemptible perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was no time for <hi>David,</hi> being in his flight, to anſwer him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſaw no hope, by anſwering ſuch a <hi>rabidus canis,</hi> (as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calls <hi>Julian</hi>) ſuch a mad dog,<note place="margin">Silence, in ſome caſes, vertuous.</note> to quiet him: and therefore he wiſely forbore a reply. It may be he hath reference to this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. where he tells how, when men did ſpeak miſchievous things againſt him, he <hi>was as a deaf man, that heard not; and as a dumb man, that openeth not his mouth:</hi> he was ſilent. It may be, by anſwering them, he ſhould have provoked them further; and therefore he would prevent their ſin. Our bleſſed Lord, before the high-Prieſt, being accuſed, held his peace,<note place="margin">Mark 14.61. And Chap 15.</note> and <hi>anſwered nothing,</hi> Mark 14. and, <hi>Mark</hi> 15. being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the high-Prieſts, he anſwered nothing. Saint <hi>Chryſostom</hi> gives the reaſon; He knew he ſhould nothing advantage his cauſe, nor perſwade them; but enflame them further: And he would not anſwer <hi>Herod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 23.9.</note> when he earneſtly queſtioned him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. So would not he anſwer a word, when theſe did malitiouſly accuſe him. Nay, there is one example above all the reſt, (ſave Chriſt:) When railing <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> had ſpoken moſt blaſphemouſly againſt God, it is ſaid, <hi>The people held their peace, and anſwered him not a word;</hi> and that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had commanded them not to anſwer him,<note place="margin">2 Kings 18.36.</note> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. It was not onely to ſpite the railer with ſilence; but <hi>Hezekiah</hi> knew, by a reply, he might be exaſperated, but not reformed.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, the rebounding of thoſe multiplied blaſphemies, might make ſome ill impreſſions in the multitude; and therefore they ſuffered him to lie in his own ſmoak.</p>
            <p>To ſhut up this Point:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>It is true, in ſuch caſes as theſe, ſilence is fit, nay neceſſary: if God may loſe glory, or our brother thereby rendered the more ſinful, or if no fit time or place for ſpeaking: For it is a great piece of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to know when and where to anſwer. But all this hinders not, but that a man or woman, when unjuſt aſperſions are caſt upon them, may reply unto them, and make a juſt apologie; vindicate their reputation, and do what they can, to ſet themſelves upright in the opinion of thoſe that misjudged them. The ſervants of God have done it, in all times: God himſelf hath put into the mouthes of his Prophets, anſwers to thoſe cavils and exceptions that people have made againſt his proceedings. The Son of God himſelf did it, as it appeareth in the Goſpel: and we may lawfully do it; always provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we do it modeſtly, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did here.

               </gap>, ſuch an one as is moſt ſtiff and obdurate: a notable example we have of this in <hi>Gideon,</hi> who when he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that glorious victory over the Midianites; was ſet upon by thoſe of Ephraim, to charge him with ambition and pride, as unwilling to have any ſharers in his conqueſt; the text ſaith,<note place="margin">Judg. 8.1.</note> 
               <hi>they did chide with him ſharply: Judg.</hi> 8. He could not but be ſenſible of the affront, where he deſerved thanks, to be quarrelled for what he had done; but what did he in this caſe? Sure that which became a pious and prudent man: he did not upbrayd them with their cowardlineſs, in that they did not offer themſelves to the battle;<note place="margin">mildeneſs a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering vertue.</note> or tell them that after the exploit done, every coward can be valiant; and after the fray ended none ſpeak bigger then the fearfulleſt: nor doth he twit them with their unthankfulneſs for his good ſervice done unto them and all the people; but he gently ſpeaketh, and extenuateth his own act, and advanceth their performance; his was but a gleaning in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their full vintage; he gives them good words, and the iſſue is, Verſe 3. <hi>Their anger was abated towards him,</hi> (ſaith the text.<note place="margin">Verſ. 3.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41147:54"/> with a challenge, and charge them not only with tranſgreſſion but apoſtacy and rebellion; their words are very ſharp and ful of wrath; now had the Reubenites been as hot in their anſwer, as the other were in their charge, there had grown a bloody war, even out of a miſpriſion; but their anſwer was milde and moderate; they thought with themſelves, this act of ours though it was well meant, yet might be by interpretation ſcandalous; and therefore good reaſon our mildneſs ſhould give ſatisfaction for that offence which wee have not prevented: and their anſwer was ſo pleaſing, that the anger of the other is appeaſed; and they goe away with comfort and contentment: an other example we have in <hi>Abigail,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.</note> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. when her husband had churliſhly, and unworthily, and moſt unthankfully anſwered, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> meſſengers, that ſent for a little reliefe and had deſerved it, <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digno,</hi> to the full, by their ſecuring of his ſervants, and flocks: and that ſhe was told what danger her husband, her ſelf and family were in, thorough the juſtly incenſed diſpleaſure of <hi>David;</hi> away ſhe gets her with a preſent unto the place where <hi>David</hi> was, and falleth hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly before him, ingenuouſly confeſſing the folly and indiſcretion of her husband, beggs pardon for the fault, inſtanceth <hi>Davids</hi> merits, foretelleth his ſolemn praiſe and glory; and layeth before him the happy peace of his ſoul, in refraining from innocent blood: what was the iſſue? <hi>David</hi> relents upon this modeſt and wiſe ſpeech, and in ſtead of revenge he bleſſeth God for ſending <hi>Abigail</hi> to meet him, and her for her counſel; and rejoyceth more <hi>bene vinci, quàm male vincere:</hi> to be overcome with gracious words, then to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful victory.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>I wiſh it were taken up into our practices; for it is too cuſtomable in theſe dayes, if men ſee others enraged, and in their fury, they grow as furious as they; and becauſe (as they conceive) that they have right on their ſide, they think then they may give as bad as they bring, and bandy word for word; and execration for execration: yea, and being heated a little, they are then become ambitious of the laſt word,<note place="margin">S.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; all the reward of their victory is but ſin: a man would bleſe himſelf to ſee the carriage of that people, how furious and paſſionate they are, how they ſcorn to yeild, how earneſt to overcome in a Barrating way?<note place="margin">Cautions and remedies againſt common barrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> Oh, what reſpect is here had to the honour of God; or the credit of our profeſſion! which ſhould make us Doves, and not Vultures; Lambs and not Lions!

            <p>Well, to conclude this point; if we will ſhew our ſelves prudent and pious, let us <hi>ſeek peace, and purſue it:</hi> if we ſee them enraged, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41147:54"/> they flie upon us, give them peaceable and fair language, and, by gentleneſs, fetch them off from the ſhelf whereon they ſtick: Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence will not do it; but Meekneſs will. This, it may be, will be accounted a <gap reason="foreign">

He might have been ſoon as ſharp as ſhe, and have told her her own, (as one of the Fathers lays it down:) Why, <hi>Sarah,</hi> doſt thou ſuſpect me, as guilty of the miſcarriage of thine handmaid towards thee; or that I ſupport her in her malepert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Had I ever thought of taking this woman into my bed, but by thy motion and perſwaſion? I did herein reſpect <hi>voluntatem tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, non voluptatem meam;</hi> thy will, and not my pleaſure. Or doſt thou think, that ſhe that is ſo lately joyned unto me, (though ſhe be pregnant) can have more favour in mine eyes then thou, (though bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren) with whom I have ſo long converſed? Hath not my former carriage to thee, been as loving and reſpective as became an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? Did I ever, in all the time that thou haſt been my wife, give thee any occaſion of offence? Why ſhouldſt thou now, after ſo long experience of my conſtant love, grow into a jealouſie and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of me? Thou art led by Paſſion, and not guided by Reaſon But now, that thou mayeſt ſee how free I am from what thou char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt me withal: I give thine handmaid into thine own power, to do with her as thou pleaſeſt.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon why he was ſo gentle to her at this time, was,</p>
            <p>Firſt, he conſidered ſhe was his wife, and as neer unto him as his own fleſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Calvin on the place.</note> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith) He conſidered how loyal and obedient ſhe had been unto him, all her time; ſhe had never diſpleaſed him hitherto; and therefore this preſent errour was the more to be born withal: the firſt offence, where the whole courſe hath been formerly fair, pleads for pardon: Even <hi>Balaams aſs</hi> can plead that, when ſhe cruſhed his foot againſt the wall, and fell down under him: <hi>Was I ever wont to do ſo unto thee?</hi> Numb. 22.30.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Conjugal love and prudence.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham</hi> wiſely conſidered the ſtrength of the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that his wife had: for, to be ſcorned and deſpiſed by an inferiour, yea, by ſuch an one, that one hath raiſed and advanced to what they are, is no ſmall affliction.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he conſidered alſo, that jealouſie (which is an exceſs of love) hath ſudden and ſhrewd effects.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:41147:55"/>
            <p>And laſtly, (which is the main of all) he conſidered her ſex; ſhe was a woman; and Paſſion is incident to that ſex: and therefore he bare with her infirmity. He practiſed that which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave in precept,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.1.</note> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. for <hi>husbands</hi> to <hi>dwell with</hi> their <hi>wives, as men of knowledge;</hi> and to <hi>favour them, as the weaker veſſels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here is an high and holy example for husbands to follow, how to carry themſelves towards the infirmities of their wives.</p>
            <p>Infirmities are of two ſorts:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Husbandly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention.</note>1. Some are natural, inward imperfections; as, ſlowneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and apprehenſion, ſhortneſs of memory, haſtineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Outward: as lameneſs, blindneſs, deafneſs, or any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or deformity of body. Theſe ſhould have pity, compaſſion, and commiſeration, yea a greater tenderneſs and reſpect. <hi>Abraham</hi> did not love <hi>Sarah</hi> the leſs, becauſe ſhe was barren; nay, <hi>Elkanah</hi> gave his wife a double portion, becauſe of this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, infirmities are not all tranſgreſſions and breaches of Gods law; as ſhrewiſhneſs, waywardneſs, peeviſh ſullenneſs. Now theſe, though they may be ſeaſonably, in due time and place, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;<note place="margin">Prov. 19.</note> yet, where the matter is not great, as good not take notice of them: it is the <hi>glory</hi> of a man, to <hi>paſs by</hi> an offence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>Such a bearing there muſt be with the wife, and that upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ground, ſhe being <hi>the weaker veſſel.</hi> Precious things, whereof we make account, the weaker they be, the more tenderly and charily they are to be handled: as <hi>China</hi>-diſhes, and Cryſtal-glaſſes, and the like. Of all parts of the body, the eye is moſt tenderly uſed and touched. Now what things, what perſons are more precious then a wife? and yet withal, a weak veſſel, and therefore to be born withal. Beſides, the husbands count themſelves ſtronger: now the <hi>ſtrong</hi> are to <hi>bear</hi> with <hi>the infirmities of the weak,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15.1.</note> Rom. 15. we know the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Zipporah</hi> to <hi>Moſes;</hi> and we read alſo of his meek carriage towards her. Yea, when <hi>Jezebel</hi> had uſed thoſe upbraiding words towards <hi>Ahab,</hi> and reproached him with a flatneſs of ſpirit, as if he were not worthy to ſway a Scepter; he replieth not.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>It meets with ſome husbands in theſe times, who, if the wife be a little moved, they are preſently on the houſe top, and are as paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate as they; nay grow to vilifying and depraving words; as if the wife had been taken out of the foot, and not the ſide: and they ſtand ſo much upon their headſhip and authority, that they think the wife offendeth, but they do not. But where is the wiſdom that ſhould be in thoſe Heads? Do thoſe <hi>dwell with their wives as men of knowledge?</hi> Are thoſe men ſtrong, that are ſubject to this impotence of paſſion, and ſhew themſelves rather women then men? Is this to <hi>bear</hi> with the <hi>weaker veſſel;</hi> or rather, to cruſh and ſhatter, what they ſhould but tenderly touch.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, let it teach husbands, as they take knowledge
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41147:55"/> of their dignity, ſo to learn their duty; and that is, to bear with the infirmities of their yoke-fellows. And let it be thought no digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if I preſs it upon both of them. Marriage, as it is <hi>honourable,</hi> ſo it is a comfortable condition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yet, as ſweet as it is, and as loving as poſſibly the parties can be; there will intervene ſomething, that will require each others patience and forbearance.</p>
            <p>Now there be certain things, that conduce much to make the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried eſtate a peaceable condition, and to make it an harbour unto them: where there may be peace and ſecurity, when the world, like the ſea, is full of tempeſts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let them not willingly give each other offence: for offence cauſeth contention.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if an offence be given by the one, (if it be but ſlight) it muſt not be taken by the other: for if both be angry together, the fire will be the greater.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the one muſt be reproved, let it be done privately, and not in the obſervation of others.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, children or ſervants muſt not be bolſtered up by the one, againſt the other.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, they muſt not twit each other with the husbands and wives of others, or with their own former wives or husbands: for compariſons, in this kinde, are very odious.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, take heed of unjuſt jealouſies and ſuſpitions of each other: for this is the bane of domeſtical peace.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, they muſt take heed of divulging each others infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which ſome take delight in; but it is an ungodly practice: had they any ſore about them, they would be loath to talk of it: And, did man and wife eſteem each other <hi>one fleſh,</hi> they would be loath to reveal each others weakneſſes.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in all things that may ſtand with a good conſcience, they ſhould ſeek to pleaſe each other; and rather ſuffer themſelves to be croſſed, then to diſcontent each other. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes this a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al duty between man and wife, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.33, 34.</note> and expreſſeth it by a word that ſignifieth more then ordinary care;<note n="*" place="margin">

               </gap>, <hi>ſet his eyes upon him;</hi> he did caſt ſuch an angry look upon him, That was his firſt correction: As there is approbation and love in looks, <hi>in oculis indulgentia,</hi> favour in the eyes. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith, he had ſeen the face of <hi>Eſau, as the face of God;</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:41147:58"/> he diſcerned by his cheerful countenance, that he was pleaſed with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.<note place="margin">Gen. 33.10.</note> and it is ſaid of that man that had made ſo fair a progreſs, that Chriſt <hi>looked upon him, and loved him,</hi> Mark. 10.21. So there is diſlike and reproofe in looks; this then is one way of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting ſervants, and that is by the countenance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a correction by words, and ſuch ſharpneſs and acrimony in it, that many a man had rather endure <hi>verbera</hi> then <hi>verba;</hi> blows then bitter words: and in this way it is lawful for maſters to correct ſervants, upon juſt occaſion.

Our Lord corrects his diſciples with words, when at one time he challengeth them for their want of faith; at another time for their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, at another time for their ſleepineſs and drouſineſs: and we ſee how ſharp he is with <hi>Peter,</hi> when he diſſwades him from his Paſſion, come <hi>behinde me Satan, thou art an offence unto me; thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but the thigs that be of men.</hi> Mat. 26.<note place="margin">Mat. 26.23. and chap. 28.</note> And ſo the Maſter that had delivered the talents, firſt correcteth the evil and unprofitable ſervant by words.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is a correction alſo by blows, which it is lawful for the maſter and miſtreſs upon juſt cauſe to uſe; for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.19. <hi>A ſervant will not be corrected with words;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Prov 29.19.</note> a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may be ſo obſtinate and untoward, that words wil doe no good: and therefore there will be need of blows and ſtripes, of which our Saviour makes mention, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47.<note place="margin">Luk. 12.47,</note>

            <p>Further yet, it is ſaid of the houſe of <hi>George</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhault,</hi> that it was an Univerſity, a Court, and a Church: If it were a Church; we know, in the Church there muſt be diſcipline, or elſe, all will go to ruine.

Among other things to give them correction when they deſerve it: not only to correct them with looks and words, but even to uſe the rod; <hi>Withhold not correction from the childe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) Prov.</hi> 23.<note place="margin">Prov. 23.13</note> 
               <hi>for if thou beateſt him with the rod, he ſhall not dye:</hi> therefore a ſervant may, and muſt be corrected when there is cauſe, as well as ſet at work, fed and cloathed: yea correction is ſometimes as neceſſary as meat; for by this are the ears opened, (as he in <hi>Job</hi> ſaith) to inſtruction.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Let maſters, as they have authority to correct, ſo make conſcience of doing it, as well as of others things which they are bound to do to their ſervants; and let them make conſcience of keeping up that authority that God hath inveſted them in: I can tell you of ſeveral wayes whereby maſters and miſtreſſes loſe their authority.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when they are light in their behaviour, and fooliſh in their carriage, in the ſight of their ſervants; or when they are exceſſive in the obſervation of their ſervants; <hi>Nabal</hi> was ſuch an one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſervants deſpiſed him; and would ſay, he was a ſon of Belial, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.17.</note> There is gravity required in thoſe that be in place of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and their carriage ſhould be ſuch as ſhould render them aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto ſervants. This is that which <hi>David</hi> did profeſs; that he would behave himſelf <hi>wiſely,</hi> and ſo walk-in midſt of his houſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, when maſters and miſtreſſes are too indulgent to their ſervants, and make them hail fellow well met; when they thus let fall their authority, that ſervants do not know their diſtance; no wonder though they grow deſpicable: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by brings up his ſervant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 29.21.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall have him become his ſon at length,</hi> Prov. 29. It is thought that this proverb hath reference to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> whom <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſhewed great affection unto, and had indeed tendered above the degree of a ſervant; and it is well known how inſolent he grew: and the like may be thought of <hi>Ziba,</hi> that <hi>Mephiboſbeth</hi> did uſe him ſo familiarly, that the perfidious fellow grew inſolent; and even ſo bold,<note place="margin">lib. de legibus.</note> as to delate him to the king, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. And it is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that <hi>Plato</hi> giveth, that maſters ſhould not be familiar with ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for they are apt to take too much heart by this; and to grow croſs, in ſtead of obeying;</p>
            <p>Thirdly, governors loſe their authority, when they are overruled by their ſervants, to do any thing that is unlawful, and unjuſt; as we ſee in <hi>Joaſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 24.17.</note> that was drawn by his ſervants to Idolatry; 2 <hi>King.</hi> 24. and <hi>Zedechiah,</hi> who gave the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> into the hands of his ſervants,<note place="margin">Jer. 38.5.</note> 
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. with this baſe and abject ſpeech; <hi>the king is not be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41147:59"/> that can deny you any thing,</hi> do any thing againſt you: thus will ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſoon prove maſters; and when they come to this high pitch, they will prove intollerable: for this is one of the four things that the wiſe man ſaith, the earth cannot bear; <hi>a ſervant when he reigneth Prov.</hi> 30. when the ſervants ride on horſes, and the maſters walk on foot: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. how pitiful is it!<note place="margin">Prov. 30 22. Eccleſ. 10.7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthy, they loſe their authority when they come within the lurch of their ſervants; that is, when they know thoſe things by them, that they are afraid they ſhould reveal; and ſo dare not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or puniſh them, for fear they ſhould open their mouthes againſt them: as it is ſaid of him in Tacitus;<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
               <hi>validior erat apud libidines Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis, quàm ut poenâ afficeretur:</hi> he was more intimate to the vices of his Prince, then to ſuffer any puniſhment from him.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they loſe their authority, when they are ſo remiſs, that they pray and intreat ſervants, where they may command them; howſoever this might be called mildeneſs, if they had to deal with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals; yet when with ſervants, it is dulneſs and flatneſs of ſpirit, and a forgetfulneſs of that power which God hath put into their hands: for the Centurion by his own ſpeech did otherwiſe. <hi>I ſay to my ſervant, do this and he doth it; come, and he cometh; goe, and he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> and ſo the Church in the <hi>Canticles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 3.5.</note> taking upon her the perſon of a miſtreſs, ſaith <hi>I charge you</hi> not to do this.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, they loſe their authority by not correcting of ſervants when there is juſt cauſe; and giving them blows when they deſerve them: for what will they ſay? I know my maſter or miſtreſs will ſcoul or frown, it may be they will chide, but they will not fight; and therfore the frown is eaſily digeſted, and the words are but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted winde, and ſo they come to deſpiſe them: but maſters muſt know they doe not perform their duty towards God; nay they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the power which God hath given them; when they do not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, in looks, in words, yea by blows if there be deſert; and they are guilty of thoſe further miſdemeanours that their ſervants run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and God hath the ſame quarrel with them, that he had againſt <hi>Eli;</hi> his ſons made themſelves vile, he reſtrained them not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.12.</note> He dealt too mildely with them, and he ſtroked thoſe heads he ſhould have wounded; he gave but only ſoft words, too eaſie a doſe; for it did rather ſtirr and irritate the humour, then purge out the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and therefore both he and his ſons periſhed for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly obſerve, ſhe dealt hardly with her;<note place="margin">lib de Ab. c. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> though ſhe had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to correct her, yet as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>immoderatiùs permiſſâ ultione utitur;</hi> ſhe uſeth lawful correction unlawfully, immoderatly: and ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41147:60"/> correct ſervants. The task-maſters in <hi>Egypt</hi> did cruelly beat the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, if they fell ſhort of their work, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. And for this cruelty of both <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his task-maſters, God gave in charge to <hi>Iſrael, Levit.</hi> 25.<note place="margin">Levit. 25.43.</note> that, in regard they had been ſervants in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they ſhould not rule over ſuch with rigour.<note place="margin">Exod. 21.20.</note> And we ſhall finde, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. that if a ſervant died under his maſters hand, when he corrected him, (though he did not intend to kill him) he was to be puniſhed: and if he did ſmite out an eye or tooth; he was to make him recompence, verſ. 26. And becauſe he foreſaw that men would be prone to too much cruelty in correcting, he ſet the number of ſtripes, which might not be exceeded,<note place="margin">Deut. 25.3. And 22.6.</note> 
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. The Lord was ever againſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty toward the very brute creatures:<note place="margin">Exod. 23.19.</note> he would not have them <hi>ſeethe a kid in the mothers milk,</hi> Exod. 23. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. therefore he would not have them <hi>take the dam with the young. In his Commendatur Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentia &amp; Humanitas,</hi> (ſaith one;) In theſe things are Humanity and Mercy recommended. If they muſt not be cruel to beaſts, much leſs to men. God opened the mouth of <hi>Balaams</hi> aſs, and ſhe taxeth her maſter for ſtriking her,<note place="margin">Numb. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. Were the mouthes of beaſts opened now, what cauſe were there to inveigh againſt the rage and fury of ſome men againſt their beaſts; who lay on them, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, and torture them in that manner, that it yerns a mans bowels to obſerve! Well, the Lord having ſuch care of beaſts, ſurely he would not have ſervants uſed cruelly and inhumanely.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>It meets with thoſe that ſhew too much rigour towards ſervants: When they correct, they know no mean: they lay on, as if they had brute creatures to deal withal, nay ſtocks and ſtones: Yea, they will take any thing that comes next to hand, be it never ſo hard or ſharp; and thus, oftentimes, wound, and bruiſe, and lame them, and diſable them all their days; yea, ſometimes they give ſuch ſtrokes as take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way life. Do thoſe think that they deal with their own fleſh? for, <hi>we are all made of one blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> Act. 17. Do they think their ſervants bear the ſuperſcription of the Great <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as well as they? Did not one hand create them both? Did not one Chriſt redeem them both? May not the ſervant ſtand as high in the favour, as the maſter? And is not the ſervant heir of the ſame glory? Have not they a <hi>Maſter in heaven?</hi> who, if they do not to their ſervants that which is juſt and equal, will call them to an account for it,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 4.1.</note> 
               <hi>Col.</hi> 4. Do they know what may befal their children, when they ſhall come to be ſervants unto others? For they are not ſure (for all the means that they leave them) but that they may come into that condition; and ſo may feel the like cruelty from others, that their parents have ſhewed to others.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>2.</hi> The prudence and diſcretion of Corrections; with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</note>In the ſecond place, let it be an inſtruction to all maſters and miſtreſſes, to be wife and diſcreet in correcting of ſervants.</p>
            <p>Now this diſcretion conſiſteth in theſe things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, there muſt be a fault, elſe there will be more hurt done, then
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41147:60"/> good, (beſides the unrighteouſneſs of it.) If a corraſive be laid where there is no ſore, it will make one. A man muſt not correct, to ſhew his authority, and that it may be known he is a maſter: this is that which is called <hi>correcting according to their pleaſure,</hi> Heb. 12.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.10.</note> This is naught; there muſt be a cauſe, and the muſt be fault made known to the ſervant, whom a maſter doth correct; he muſt be convinced of it, as we ſee God dealt with our firſt parents, and with <hi>Cain,</hi> before he puniſhed them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, diſcretion is ſeen, in putting a difference between thoſe men that correct ſervants in yeers, and ſervants under yeers. And again, it is fitteſt for the maſter to correct the men-ſervants, and the miſtreſſes the maids; as we ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> here gives <hi>Hagar</hi> into the power of her miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, diſcretion and wiſdom is ſeen, in the order of correcting: Correction by words, muſt go before correction by blowes: and if words will do, the other needs not. And he that doth thus, imitateth God, who doth <hi>rebuke and chaſten,</hi> Rev. 3. and ſheweth, that, like God,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.19. Lament. 3.33.</note> he doth not puniſh willingly, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. Phyſitians, before they give a ſtrong potion, will give a preparative: and Chirurgians will take all courſes, before they uſe burning or amputation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, diſcretion is ſeen, in the manner of correction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it be in love: <hi>All things</hi> ſhould be <hi>done in love,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.14.</note> and therefore This, which carrieth in it a ſhew of anger. God doth thus: and we muſt correct with a deſire of the reformation of the party; and therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt joyn prayer with it: I do not mean, a formal and ſet prayer; but a lifting up of the heart to God, that he will be pleaſed to make that correction uſeful to the party.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Correction muſt not be given in paſſion: for, when one is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by paſſion, there is a miſt comes over the underſtanding, and it is apt to blinde Reaſon. <hi>Seneca</hi> tell of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> being incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt his ſervant, he deferred to correct him, ſaying, <hi>I would beat thee, if I were not angry.</hi> O that we could rob this Egyptian of this jewel! how ſhall he riſe up in judgement againſt ſuch governours, as, in the height of their fury, in the very paroxyſm, fall upon ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and care not what they do in their rage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. People ſhould correct with reflecting upon themſelves, and calling to minde their own ſins, by which they have much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God, then their ſervant hath them; yea, and juſtly puniſheth their contumacie towards him, with the ſervants negligence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to them. Again, they ſhould think how they would be uſed, if they ſhould offend; and therefore they ſhould <hi>do as they would be done unto;</hi> and then they would correct with compaſſion.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, diſcretion and wiſdom in correction is ſeen, in obſerving a right meaſure; it muſt be given, according to the nature and quality of the offence, (as you heard before, out of the Goſpel;) there be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41147:61"/> fewer and more ſtripes. If it be but a fault out of weakneſs, or in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertencie, or ignorance, an eaſie reproof will ſerve the turn: if it be a wilful errour, it requireth more: If it be an offence againſt God, if it be ſcandalous, if it be often committed, the more ſeverity is to be uſed. Still, a wiſe man <hi>poenas irrogat aequas,</hi> gives proportionable correction. And this is according to Gods example; who, (though he doth reward <hi>ultra condignum,</hi> beyond all deſert; yet) puniſheth <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 9.13.</note> leſs then any merit; as <hi>Ezra</hi> ſaith, Chap. 9.</p>
            <p>I wiſh theſe things may be obſerved: for people are apt to turn a duty into a ſin; and correct ſo, that they make themſelves liable to Gods correction.</p>
            <p>Shall I adde a little more, without the challenge of a digreſſion? A maſter may uſe a ſervant hardly, not onely in regard of Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in other things; which I wiſh may be taken knowledge of.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in regard of Food, they may uſe them hardly; when, out of a miſerable humour, they will not allow them enough to fill their bellies. It ſhould ſeem, the maſter of the Prodigal dealt ſo with him; for he was fain to <hi>eat husks</hi> with the ſwine. Or, ſecondly, when they give them enough; but it is of ſuch ſtuff, that they buy for cheapneſs ſake, and is ſcarce mans meat; yea, that which is muſtie and unſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: This is fearful. The good houſwife provides <hi>meat,</hi> and <hi>wholeſom meat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 31.</note> for her family, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. And the Prodigal could ſay, that, <hi>in his fathers houſe,</hi> the hired ſervants had bread <hi>enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Maſters may uſe ſervants hard, in regard of apparel: the good houſwife, again, provides <hi>clothing for her ſervants,</hi> Prov. 31. But we ſee how ragged and tattered the ſervants of many be, who are known to be of that ability, that they could provide better for them, if a baſe, and fordid, and miſerable ſpirit did not inſoul them, and that their conſcience were not ſtill tied up in their purſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they may uſe them hardly, in regard of labour, when they put them upon employments above their ſtrength; which was the Egyptians uſage of the Iſraelites: but that <hi>cried</hi> to God, and drew down wrath; and therefore let maſters take heed of the like cruelty, of uſing ſervants like horſes, yea worſe: Yea, and denying them ſeaſonable reſt; which is another way of ill uſage: and one end that God had, in ordaining the Sabbath, was, that the ſervant might reſt; and therefore they are contrary to God, that will defraud ſervants of their reſt, whereby they ſhould repair their ſpirits, and refreſh their bodies.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, maſters and miſtreſſes may deal too hardly with their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in time of ſickneſs. The king of <hi>Syria</hi> had ſo much care of his ſervants infirmity, that he commends him, by letters, to the king of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 5. Matth. 8.6.</note> 2 Kings 5. and the care that the Centurion had for his ſick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, is ſet down, and commended, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. But theſe times are full of ſuch as the Amalekite was, who left his ſervant, becauſe he was ſick,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.13.</note> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. had not <hi>David</hi> lighted upon him, he had periſhed.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41147:61"/> ſend them to ſome out-houſe, and take no further care: I know that thoſe people would take more care of their beaſts; ſome will take care in ſuch a caſe, but it ſhall be at the poor ſervants coſt; if they have not preſent money, if they recover, they will abate it of their wages, is this to undoe heavy burthens? or rather is not this to make the burthen heavyer? Or if they will pay it themſelves, yet they mutter and grumble, and ſay they make themſelves ſicker then they are, and they may riſe if they will. So that the poor ſervant is more troubled with theſe diſcontented ſpeeches, then with his own ſickneſs; and ſo forceth himſelf to ſtrive above his ſtrength, even to his undoing. I could tell you of ſome other kindes of hard dealing with ſervants; as when maſters and miſtreſſes will not teach their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that, for which they come; if they do, when they are neer out of their time, and think they will part from them; they will diſgrace them, and diſable them; and whereas they ſhould ſend them away with encouragment and reward (if they have been faithful;) for ſo God commanded, they muſt not <hi>goe away empty, Deut.</hi> 15.<note place="margin">Deut. 15.13.</note> they will maligne them, and envy them, and do them the worſt offices they can: <hi>Laban</hi> could have been content <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould have ſtayd with him ſtill; and therefore if he goe away, he will not only vex at it, but purſue him with hoſtility. I could ſpeak of hard uſage of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, while their wages are either detained altogether (which is no leſs then a crying ſin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. which entreth into the ears of God,<note place="margin">Jam. 5.4.</note> and doth <hi>interpellare pro vindicta,</hi> ſollicite him for vengeance;) or elſe detaining them ſo long, that it moveth them to filch and ſteal, to ſupply their neceſſities. Do theſe maſters and mſtreſſes in theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes of injuſtice, conſider that which the Apoſtle mindes them of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>That they have alſo a maſter in Heaven:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6.9.</note> 
               <hi>Job</hi> durſt not deſpiſe the cauſe of his <hi>ſervant,</hi> Chapter 31. 13. 14. becauſe if he did, he did not know how he ſhould anſwer God, when he did viſit; Oh think of this, when you uſe your ſervants with rigour; how you will be able to give account for this, when God riſeth up to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But I have held you too long in this. I come therefore to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; for we have not yet done with <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſharp correction.</p>
            <p>May we not further take knowledg,</p>

It is true, this was an exceſs of cruelty; but to do wrong to a woman with childe, by beating her (though it be a leſſer degree) is bad enough;<note place="margin">Application</note> and I wiſh all people to take heed how they be guilty of it.</p>

We now love things, and by and by we loath them; now we make much of things, and anon we caſt them off; as we do with noſe-gayes, wear them all day in our hands, and at night throw them away: we do admire ſome perſons, and after a while

And therefore we ſhould pray for Gods grace to guide us, that thoſe which ſhould be our ſervants, may not be our maſters: that we may wiſely deſire, and love, and rejoyce; and then we ſhall not alter, but upon juſt cauſe and ground.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, How eaſily people abuſe the power that is given them!<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>5.</hi> Moſt men are apt to act to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of their authority, if not exceed it.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham</hi> had given power to his wife, to correct the inſolency of her maid; and ſee, ſhe exceedeth terms of moderation. Yea? (thought ſhe) hath my husband given me leave? I will lay it on, to ſome purpoſe. The task-maſters having authority from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> we ſee how they raged againſt the poor Iſraelites: No queſtion, they exerciſed their power to the full; nay, it is probable, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their commiſſion, or elſe the people would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> againſt them. You ſee how glad the Jaylor was to have Saint <hi>Paul</hi> put into his hands; and we ſee how harſh he was towards him: he was onely bid to keep him <hi>ſafely,</hi> and he putteth him into <hi>an inner priſon, and makes his feet faſt in the ſtocks.

               </gap>, he over-looked: and when the Chriſtians complained of it, he turned them off with a flout, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they were taught to bear afflictions patiently. And we ſee in the world uſually, if men get but into a Place, (though but a mean one) and that they know they have a power, they will not onely do, but over-do. Some, out of a pride of heart, becauſe they will ſhew themſelves what they are; and ſome, out of a ſinful offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and ſubſervience to others humours, whom they think to pleaſe by their buſie doings; they are apt to do things they ſhould not do. And when we ſee a revengeful man, that hath gotten power into his hand, we ſhall be ſure to finde him to ſtretch his power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the fartheſt, for the wreaking of his own ſpleen and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. When <hi>Pilate</hi> bid the high-prieſts take Chriſt, and judge him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their law; you may well think, that if they could have entertained this offer, they would have done it, and made uſe of it to the full, for the puniſhing of him whom they hated.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe:</p>
            <p>Whatſoever the power is, that is granted us over others,<note place="margin">Application</note> let us uſe it fairly, and let us not do all we may do; for then we ſhall be apt ſoon to do that we ſhould not do. They that will live at the extent of their power, they will quickly tranſgreſs their limits; And it is dangerous walking on the very brink of the river. Moderation in that power which is committed to a man, hath ever been held praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:41147:63"/>
            <p>Secondly, it ſhould teach thoſe that are in place to derive power upon others, not to truſt paſſionate, and proud, and revengeful men with it: for, being tranſported with paſſion, and not knowing how to keep a moderation, they are apt, with <hi>Phaeton,</hi> to burn the world.</p>

            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Let maſters and miſtreſſes take heed of cruelty, and rigorous ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Apoſtle would have maſters to be <gap reason="foreign">

Now, if they muſt be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in threatnings, then certainly in blowes: for, exceſs this way, is offenſive to God, and, it may be, prejudicial to a mans eſtate, in forcing away a ſervant: yea, it may be the undoing of the ſervant; as <hi>Hagar</hi> was in the way, by this flight, to have been undone, if the Angel of God had not met her.</p>
            <p>Uſe your ſervants fairly. <hi>Satyrus,</hi> in <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> was called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, becauſe he was kinde and indulgent to his ſervants. Let Chriſtians affect this title: let them perform that which is equal and juſt to their ſervants: Let them make much of them when they do well, and, when they do ill, let them correct them; but let it be in love, and with moderation, and never immoderately. Let them but think of what they have done againſt God; and that <hi>if he were extreme to mark what is done amiſs,</hi> how they are not <hi>able to abide it:</hi> if he ſhould <hi>deal with them after their ſins,</hi> and <hi>reward them after their iniquities,</hi> they ſhould even <hi>ſuck out the dregs</hi> of the vial: they ſhould not onely be beaten with <hi>rods,</hi> but with <hi>ſcorpions;</hi> and ſuffer the puniſhments both of this life, and that which is to come.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>be ye therefore merciful, as your Father in heaven is merciful;</hi> and be ſuch maſters to your ſervants, as you deſire to finde God a Maſter to you.</p>

               <note place="margin">Application</note>It meets with divers ſervants in theſe times, whoſe ſtoutneſs is ſuch, that they will not endure any kinde of Correction: If it be but in frowns, you ſhall have them as ſowre as their maſters and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes; and they will pout, and lowre, and vie with them in this way: If it be in words, they will preſently chop Logick, and bandy word for word, without any modeſtie or ſobriety: And if it come to blowes, by no means they will endure this; they ſcorn to be beaten, they came not for that end; and therefore they will ſtruggle and ſtrive with maſter or miſtreſs; yea, ſometimes, even ſtrike again; and if they cannot make their party good, then they will run away; as ſhe here in our Text.</p>
            <p>Why, (will ſome ſay) Why ſhould any one be ſubject to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited humour of another? We may be miſuſed, and maimed.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: Where maſters and miſtreſſes be unreaſonable in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">Servants flight unlawful.</note> and make a practice of it, it is lawful to ſeek redreſs, by means of friends; and if that will not do, it is lawful to ſeek to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, for his help: but for any ill uſage, it is not lawful to run away.</p>
            <p>And therefore, in the ſecond place, though it be <hi>durus ſerme</hi> to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, an hard ſaying, that they muſt endure correction at the hands of their governours; they muſt digeſt it: And there be many things to help them in the ſwallowing of this bitter Pill; divers of them are preſſed by S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.18.</note> in the former place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, and ſo forward.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he ſaith, If the puniſhment be deſerved, there is no great <hi>thanks</hi> in ſuffering: <hi>Quae venit ex merito, poena ferenda;</hi> That mulct is to be born patiently, that cometh deſervedly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, but if we ſuffer unjuſtly, then it is <hi>thank-worthy;</hi> and glorious, to be patient.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is acceptable to God; and ſurely he will remember to reward us for it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he ſaith, We are <hi>hereunto called,</hi> verſ. 25. Our Chriſtian calling requireth to <hi>turn the other cheek,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.39.</note> Matth. 5. to <hi>give place to wrath, Rom.</hi> 12.19. to <hi>overcome evil with goodneſs,</hi> verſ. 21. And if Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt ſhew ſuch patience to all men, even to their equals; how much more, ſervants to maſters?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, he maketh ſervants, by this, conformable to Chriſt, <hi>who being reviled, reviled not again; and ſuffering, threatned not, but commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:41147:64"/>
            <p>There may be added to all this, ſixthly, that a ſervants patient endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of correction, may be a means (through Gods mercy) to work the ſter to more mildneſs and greater gentleneſs for aftertimes; whereas ſullenneſs and impudence doth more incenſe and harden him; and maketh him upon the next occaſion, more violent.<note place="margin">Greg. lib. <hi>1.</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alog.</note> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> commendeth one <hi>Libertinus,</hi> who having a ſtool thrown at him by his Abbot (with which his face became blew and ſwelled,) he took it ſo patiently (confeſſing it to be his own fault and not his maſters cruelty;) which patient carriage of his, ſo wrought upon the abbot, that he became a very milde man; and ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas diſcipuli, magiſtra facta eſt magiſtri,</hi> the patience of the ſchollar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſucceſsful inſtructor of his hmaſter</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let it be remembred by ſervants, that when upon correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they flye away, they add but one ſin to another; and if they think to be revenged on their maſters this way, it is worſe; and what a poor revenge is it, to hurt ones own ſoul, to be revenged on another! this was the practice of <hi>Thamar</hi> towards her father in law. Fearful it is, when we will revenge our ſelves; nay hurt our ſelves, yea our ſouls, to hurt anothers body; ſuch <hi>wrath worketh not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One other Uſe of it:</p>
            <p>And that is to us all; we cenſure ſervants for impatience under their corrections; I would we would reflect upon our own carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, when we are in the way of ſin; we are told of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God that will inherit it, we regard it not, we will do what ſeemeth good in our own eyes; and yet, when we ſuffer for it, we murmur, and repine, and take on, as if we had hard meaſure: we are apt to expoſtulate with God, why am I thus? and wherefore is this come upon me? and our hearts boyl up with tumultuous and diſcontented thoughts againſt him. Thus what we finde fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in ſervants, we practiſe in our ſelves; we deſpiſe Gods commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet are vexed when we ſuffer for our tranſgreſſions; we might have prevented it, and yet angry when puniſhed for it. But more of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>We come now to the third part of this Chapter, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſeventh Verſe, to the fifteenth; wherein is contained the Angels meeting with <hi>Hagar,</hi> being fled from her miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his queſtioning with her about the cauſe of her flight.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the direction he gives unto her, upon the diſcovery of that cauſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, his prediction concerning the childe that ſhe went withal.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of theſe (laid down in the ſeventh Verſe) we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>that the Angel of the Lord found her.</hi>

            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41147:65"/>
            <p>Secondly, where he found her; by a Fountain of water in the wilderneſs; by the Fountain in the way to <hi>ſhur.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>God is good to <hi>Solomon</hi> for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake, yea to <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> yea even to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> long after; for he faith, he will defend <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> even for <hi>David</hi> his ſervants ſake; the whole company for one good mans ſake, as we ſee in the ſhip where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>3.</hi> Of the good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do us: touching guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Angels, and the duties we are to return them <hi>Pſal. 34.7. and 91.11.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>The Angel of the Lord found her.</hi> If this were a created Angel, we ſee what good offices thoſe bleſſed Spirits do for men.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they doe reveal things unto them, as we ſee in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and Saint <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> and ſo to Saint <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they direct men what they ſhall do, as we read the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel did <hi>Philip, Act.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they protect them from danger, they pitch their tents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Gods people, as we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91 and they <hi>carry them in their hands,</hi> that they hurt not their foot <hi>againſt a ſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, they bring them out of danger, as the Angel did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> out of priſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they comfort them after troubles, as we ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, they revenge them on their enemies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. and ſo <hi>the Angel of the Lord ſlew in the Hoſte of Sennacherib, an hundred four ſure and five thouſand</hi> in one night.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:41147:65"/>
            <p>Seventhly, they convey the ſouls of Gods people to happineſs, as the Angels carried the ſoul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom;</hi>) and a ſweet burthen too,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Chryſoſtom.</note> an acceptable ſervice unto them; yea they take care of their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; as <hi>Moſes:</hi> there was a conteſtation between <hi>Michael</hi> and the devil, about the body of <hi>Moſes.</hi> In a word, they are <hi>miniſtring ſpirits ſent forth to miniſter for them that ſhall be heires of ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 1. It is not to be ſaid what good offices they do for Gods people,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.10.</note> both privately and poſitively.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Application</note> it lets us ſee the happy and honourable condition of Gods ſervants; <hi>David</hi> having ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. that the <hi>Angel of the Lord pitched his tent about them that fear him,</hi> he addeth, Verſe 8. <hi>Taſte and ſee how gracious the Lord is:</hi> to wit, in allowing of his children ſo glorious an attendance. It is accounted a great matter of ſtate in the world, to have a large train of followers, in ſilks and gold chains; alas, this is but beggary to the attendance of Gods people. It was a great favour to poor <hi>Mordecai,</hi> to have <hi>Haman</hi> the Kings favourite to wait upon him when he rode through the city; what honour then for a poor man that is the childe of God, to have thoſe glorious ſons of the morning, thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (for ſo they are called;) thoſe <hi>gods</hi> to wait upon him? the very little ones have their Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.10.</note> and <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his magnificence and royalty,<note place="margin">S. Bernard, <hi>ſuper</hi> Pſal. 91.11.</note> 
               <hi>was not like one of theſe:</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> upon the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91. <hi>Qui habitat,</hi> loſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this meditation upon thoſe words; <hi>He hath given his Angels charge over thee: Quis? Quibus? de Quo? &amp; Quid mandavit?</hi> Who? to whom? concerning whom? and what is it that is here commanded? <hi>Deus mandavit, &amp; Angelis ſuis mandavit, &amp; de te ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine mandavit, &amp; ut custodiant te in omnibus viis mandavit: Domine Quid eſt homo!</hi> 'Tis God that hath commanded, that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his own Angels, <hi>his Angels concerning thee,</hi> I, and <hi>to keep thee in all thy wayes;</hi> Lord what is man!</p>
            <p>Secondly, this ſhould be a comfort to Gods people in regard of thoſe many afflictions that they are like to meet withal in the world; they have a good guard.<note place="margin">The queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Angels.</note> It hath been a queſtion much diſputed, whether every man hath his particular Angel. And it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but that moſt of the Greek Fathers, and many of the Latine, and all the Schoolmen; yea, and ſome of the late writers, and thoſe of the Proteſtant party, have gone this way: taking encouragement from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. and Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Angel, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. but what ſhould we need to trouble our ſelves about it, when not onely one, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Angels, wait upon every childe of God: And <hi>they are all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits, ſent forth</hi> for their good: there is comfort then in this: it is true, we ſee not theſe good Angels our guardians; no more do we the evil ones: and yet we doubt not, but they are ready to do us hurt; why then do we queſtion the good done to us by the other? If
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41147:66"/> our eyes were opened,<note place="margin">2 Kings 6.</note> as <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervants were, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. we ſhould ſee, that <hi>there are more with us then againſt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, let us carry our ſelves fittingly, in regard of thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirits that are ſtill about us. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth the women to carry themſelves decently in the Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.10.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe of the angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. If we may <hi>grieve the Spirit of God by our evil converſation,</hi> Epheſ. 4.30. ſurely we may grieve theſe bleſſed ſpirits: If they <hi>joy at our converſion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 15.10.</note> Luke 15. they muſt be grieved with our badneſs; and we may make the ſervice they do us, tedious unto them; yea, for them going.</p>
            <p>I know, we may do too much to the Angels, and that is, in adoring them, in invocating them, and making our prayers unto them; a thing condemned in Scripture; and ſo in the ancient Councel of <hi>Laodicea, Ne adoremus Angelos,</hi> We may not worſhip Angels. Their jugling tricks of <hi>adornemus Angulos,</hi> will not fit their turns; Let us adorn the corners of the temple:<note place="margin">Binius Concil.</note> In the Greek, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Binius</hi> cannot but acknowledge it Angels, (though he put <hi>Angulos,</hi> in the corner, as a different reading.) Again, they are <hi>ſervi Dei,</hi> the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, and may not have their Maſters honour: Nay, they are <hi>conſervi,</hi> our fellow-ſervants; and upon that ground, the Angel refuſed adoration from Saint <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. Now, as I ſay we may give them too much; ſo we may give them too little, while we will not ſhew our reverence unto them, by an holy carriage; but diſtaſte them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Baſil, <hi>in</hi> Pſal. 34.</note> by our prophaneneſs. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: As the ſmoke driveth away Bees, and noiſom ſmells the Doves: ſo will our ſins profligate and put to flight theſe guarding-Angels.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, let us learn of the glorious Angels, that as they are willing to ſerve us, ſo we ſhould be willing to do good offices for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and though we be above them in place, yet to ſerve them in love. Thus we, that look one day to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as the angels,</hi> ſhould be like them in This. Yea, we have a greater example, and that is from the Son of God himſelf, that emptied himſelf of glory, and came as lowe as <hi>the form of a ſervant,</hi> and ſtooped as lowe as the Croſs, to do us good. If he had ſtood upon his dignity, where had our Salvation been? Therefore, <hi>Let the ſame minde be in us, that was in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>4.</hi> Gods Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence, and mans vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments.</note>Some do think, that this was no created Angel, but the Son of God himſelf, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity; who did, in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, appear oftentimes to holy men. And the reaſon of this conceit is, becauſe he ſaith, verſ. 10. <hi>I will multiply thy ſeed exceedingly;</hi> which is the work of God, and not of any creature. But this is no convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing argument; for ſuch words might be put into the mouth of a created Angel, as ſpeaking from God. But be it ſo, that it was God himſelf that found <hi>Hagar,</hi> it will help us to this Obſervation, (as one hath it upon my Text;)
<q>

            <p>For, ſaith my Author, <hi>Abraham,</hi> no queſtion, after he miſſed her, (out of his love to her, eſpecially to the childe ſhe went withal; and, it may be, out of worſe, for the ſcope that he had given to his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate wife) ſought for her in every corner, but could not light on her: Though he could not, yet God findeth her; being in all places, nothing can eſcape his eye and obſervation. <hi>Am I a God at hand, and not a God afar off?</hi> Jer. 23.

He is <hi>intra omnia, &amp; extra omnia; ſupra omnia, &amp; infra omnia,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory:</hi> Within all things, and without all things; above all, and beneath all things. It is true, he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid to come unto a place, and to depart out of a place; and to deſcend: but we muſt know, this is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (as the Greek Father ſaith) a condeſcenſion to our weakneſs; for he changeth not place, who filleth all places: but it is to be underſtood of the manifeſtation of himſelf, by the effects of his Mercy or Anger; and ſo, onely, he is ſaid to come or depart.</p>
            <p>Now for the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>It ſhould teach us all, to take heed of ſinning againſt God,<note place="margin">Application</note> upon hope to convey our ſelves from him. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit; or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence?</hi> Pſal. 139.<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.7. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>If I aſcend up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell thou art there: if I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt parts of the ſea, even there ſhall thine hand lead me, and thy right hand ſhall hold me. If I ſay, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall cover me, even the night ſhall be light about me; yea, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hideth not from thee, but the night ſhineth as the day: the darkneſs and the light are both alike to thee.</hi> Men may by flight eſcape the judgement of men; but they cannot eſcape Gods hand: As he is <gap reason="foreign">

It ſeemeth to be the thought of thoſe wilde ones in <hi>Job,</hi> and the <hi>ancients</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> But it is a fooliſh thought; for,<note place="margin">Ezek. 8.</note> 
               <hi>all the ways of men are before the eyes of the Lord,</hi> (ſay both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon;</hi>) he knoweth all their natural, all their moral actions; and he needs no information, for that which is done in the moſt private cabinet, or darkeſt vault. And for mens perſons, they are not hid from him: <hi>Thine hand</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>ſhall finde out thine enemies;</hi>

            <p>Let us <hi>ſtand in awe, and ſin not:</hi> for if we ſin, upon a preſumption that we ſhall conceal either our actions or perſons from God, it is a forlorn hope; our <hi>iniquities will finde us out,</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> told the <hi>Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites:</hi>) and we that have ſinned ſecretly, may (perhaps) be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed openly, in the eye and obſervation of others.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, the place where the Angel found her; In the <hi>deſert,</hi> by <hi>a fountain.</hi> A great way had this poor woman wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and, after a good while wandering, the Angel meeteth her. He could have met with her, and ſpent that reproof upon her which afterwards he doth, quickly after ſhe removed from <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, in the beginning of her flight: but he letteth her alone (ſaith <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> upon my Text) for a certain time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Muſculus</hi> in locum.</note> till her proud ſtomack was a little come down, and that now her neceſſity had abated her ſpirit, and that ſhe began to bethink her ſelf: What, have I (for a few blowes, for which I cannot ſay but I gave the occaſion) caſt my ſelf into this exigent? Am I in a place deſtitute of comfort and relief? What ſhall become of me? I ſhall either be a prey to wilde beaſts, or elſe periſh with famine.</p>

               </note>God oftentimes ſpareth dealing with people for their faults, till they be a little pinched with the effects of their own errour.</q>
            <p>For, while they are in their heat, they have no ear open to inſtruction; but when they ſmart a little, then they will be docible. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2. the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are compared (by the Prophet) to a <hi>wilde aſs</hi> uſed to the wilderneſs, that <hi>ſnuffeth up the winde: In her occaſion, who can turn her away?

               <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, (in <hi>Job</hi>) that <hi>God ſpeaks once and twice unto men, and they perceive it not; in a dream, in a viſion of the night.</hi> Thoſe be eaſie ways, Chap. 33. but then, verſ. 16. <hi>He openeth the ears of men, and ſealeth their inſtruction:</hi> that is, he deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with them by way of correction, and ſo openeth their ears: and the reaſon of this, he giveth in the next verſe, to be the abatement of mens pride: their proud hearts muſt firſt down, and then they will lend an ear; and, as it followeth, verſ. 22. <hi>When the ſoul draweth neer to the grave, then is the meſſenger of peace gratious unto him.</hi> When <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> is in her jollity,<note place="margin">Hoſea 2.</note>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41147:67"/> upon the ſatisfaction of his voluptuous humour. No thought of father, or fathers houſe, till all was ſpent: But when he came to be pinched with famine, then he began to think of returning. When <hi>Paul</hi> was in his full carreer, there was no talking to him; he was mad upon his way, as himſelf ſaith: but being thrown from his horſe, he <hi>trembled,</hi> and was <hi>aſtoniſhed;</hi> and then he began to liſten: nay, God ſuffereth him (for the more mollifying of him, and fitting his heart for the impreſſions of his grace) to be three days in terrour of minde, without uſe of his eyes, without ſuſtenance.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>Let us acknowledge the wiſdom of our good God,<note place="margin">Application</note> in dealing with us: He ſees our diſpoſition, how, in our jollity, we hearken not unto him; we forget both him and our ſelves: and therefore he changeth his hand, and ſuffers us to come into ſome ſtraight, before he will parley with us: yea, it may be, he lets us continue a good while in perplexity; for upon the firſt laying on of the rod, it may be, we will ſtamp and chaſe; but when it ſtill lies on, and (like the bird caught) we ſtruggle but onely to our further entanglement, we lie quiet, and then our ſpirit comes down, and God may have ſome reaſon at our hands. It is like enough, that this <hi>Hagar</hi> in our Text, when ſhe broke from her miſtreſs, came away in ſuch a paſſion, that ſhe cared not what became of her, rather then ſtay there; and her miſtreſs ſhould ſee how little ſhe cared for her ſervice: But by that time ſhe is bitten with wearineſs and want, ſhe becometh more pliable. God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to take down the ſtouteſt ſtomack: and though they ſtorm and rage, (when touched by him) and be like <hi>a wilde ball in a net,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 51.20.</note> Iſai. 51. yet he will humble them at laſt. When one hath ſtruck a great fiſh, he plungeth and flounceth: well, the Angler gives him line, and lets him weary himſelf, even till he may be taken up with the hand of a childe. And let us all learn to ſubmit to Gods courſes; let him do with us what he will: let us be content that plaiſter lie on, (though it ſmart) till it have done the work. We muſt be ſoftened, before we can be moulded. God is the Phyſitian and Healer of his people, and he knows the fitteſt means and ſeaſon for redreſs.</p>
            <p>Again: <hi>He found her by a fountain of water in the wilderneſs.</hi> See,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>6.</hi> Such is Gods goodneſs, that his mercies are ſtill interwoven with extorted judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> (ſaith my Author) <hi>In deſerte reperit fontem,</hi> ſhe findes a fountain of water in the deſert. She was weary and thirſty, in this vaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable ſolitude; and now ſhe findeth a fountain to refreſh her: And what could be more acceptable to her, at this time? This is the goodneſs of God, that <hi>in the midſt of anger, he remembreth mercy, Hab.</hi> 3. He correcteth <hi>in judgement,</hi> not <hi>in fury,</hi> Jer. 10.<note place="margin">Hab. 3.2. Jer. 10.24.</note> Though this woman deſerved to have taſted more deeply of that cup, yet God mingleth ſome comfort with it: <hi>In meaſure will he debate with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Iſai. 27. Mercy lays hold upon his Juſtice,<note place="margin">Iſai. 27.8.</note> and <hi>ſuffereth not his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe.</hi> All the ways of God are interweaved with mercy; yea, the very damned in hell finde this:<note place="margin">Application</note> for though a greater
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41147:68"/> judgement could not befal them, <hi>extenſivè,</hi> in regard of continuance, (for it is everlaſting;) yet, <hi>intenſivè,</hi> he could lay more upon them: he could lay more upon them then they ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we may obſerve again,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>7.</hi> God can ſupply comforts unto the moſt deſolate places and caſes.</note>
               <hi>That God is able to furniſh us with comforts, in the moſt deſolate places:</hi> and when men think their caſe moſt dark and deſperate, he can make light break out. <hi>In deſerto fons;</hi> a fountain even in the deſart.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Jacob</hi> is full of grief, and lieth in the open field, and hath heaven onely for his canopie, and an hard ſtone for his pillow; God refreſheth him with a ſweet viſion. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is ſold into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and yet, even there, he findes good entertainment: and when he is caſt into priſon, there alſo he findes favour: And he findes cauſe to call his firſt ſon <hi>Manaſſeh, becauſe God had made him to forget his trouble;</hi> and his ſecond, <hi>Ephraim, becauſe God had made him fruitful in the land of his affliction.</hi> When <hi>Moſes</hi> is expoſed to <hi>Nilus,</hi> there is one takes him up, and gives him a liberal education. When <hi>Elijah</hi> fainteth <hi>under the juniper-tree,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 19.</note> there is meat provided for him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. Did the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> want any thing, in the vaſt wilderneſs? There is a <hi>fourth</hi> to the three children, even when they are in the <hi>fiery furnace.</hi> S. <hi>John,</hi> in the place of his baniſhment, hath his Revelations. How many of us have found friends, where we leaſt looked for them and comforts, where we leaſt expected them!</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>And therefore, let none of us diſtruſt the care of a good God, who can furniſh out conſolations, in our greateſt perplexities; and can give us that which ſhall ſweeten our bitter Potion: he that can give <hi>honey</hi> and <hi>water</hi> out of the <hi>ſtony rock;</hi> he that can make a dry ſtock bloom, and bloſſom, and bring forth ripe fruit: <hi>Why then do we doubt, O we of little faith!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is yet another thing: <hi>By the fountain, in the way to Shur;</hi> which (as S <hi>Jerome</hi> obſerveth) was directly in the way to <hi>Egypt,</hi> her own country. So that Expoſitors do collect, that, by her taking this way, ſhe was purpoſed to return to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo to renounce the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that ſhe had embraced; and ſo, <hi>Sus ad volutabrum,</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith;) <hi>The ſow to the wallowing in the mire.</hi> And here we ſee,
<q>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>8.</hi> The fearful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; with the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies thereof.</note>What fearful events of diſcontentment there ſometimes be.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She was ſo vexed at the ſharp correction of her miſtreſs, that ſhe is not onely neglective of her body, what miſery that come into; but regardleſs of her ſoul, that ſhe is ready to relapſe into her old way of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>This is too often ſeen: When people are diſcontented, they take ſtrange courſes. <hi>Saul</hi> is ſo vexed that he hath no anſwer, by <hi>Urim,</hi> nor the Prophets, that he runs to <hi>the witch of Endor</hi> for counſel. <hi>David</hi> is ſo diſcontented at <hi>Sauls</hi> continued purſuit of him, that he caſteth himſelf among the <hi>Philiſtims;</hi> which (if God had not been the more merciful) had been the next means of his confuſion. <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for the loſs of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he will not be comforted: And

               </gap>d inſtances have we had, in the like kinde!

And for that particular of apoſtatizing from the Faith,<note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> 
               <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſaith of <hi>Valentinus,</hi> that miſſing of a Biſhoprick, he took it ſo ill, that he ſet on foot his deſperate Opinion. And ſo <hi>Julian,</hi> (againſt whom S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writes) <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine. Theodoret.</note> being diſcontented for miſſing of the like preferment, turned <hi>Pelagian.</hi> And upon the ſame ground, we have known, in theſe later times, both Clergie-men and Lay-men, to turn Papiſts. And <hi>Theodoret</hi> telleth us, how <hi>Arrius,</hi> out of his envie and diſcontentment at the preferment of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that good man, ſet on foot his deviliſh Tenet againſt the Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality of the Son with the Father.</p>
            <p>The Uſe is this:</p>
            <p>That we pray to God for his grace,<note place="margin">Application</note> that we may bear afflictions pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently: for if they work upon us too deeply, the devil is a ſubtil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and (as the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> did by the Sichemites) he will fall upon us while we are <hi>ſore;</hi> he will bring all our ſins to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and aggravate them by all poſſible circumſtances; and he will do what he can, to make us injurious both to our bodies and ſouls. God knows, we are too much fleſh, the beſt of us; and when our ſins and afflictions make too deep impreſſions in us, Satan hath ſuch a faſt friend of the fleſh, that they joyn hands together, and put us on to that which is both againſt Reaſon and Religion. Yea, let Miniſters and others ſpeak unto them, it is with them as with the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when there was an improvement of their vexation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Exod. 6.9.</note> 
               <hi>They hearkened not to Moſes, for anguiſh of ſpirit, and cruel bondage.</hi> We grow careleſs, and care not what door we go out at, what iſſue comes of it. Oh that we could but admit of theſe thoughts in our afflictions: Who are we, that we ſhould not ſometimes have occaſion of diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! And why ſhould we look always to fail with winde and tide? Are we better then our fathers, and others of Gods people? 2. Have we not deſerved that God ſhould change his hand? 3. Hath not God the chief ſtroke in all afflictions; and dare we murmure againſt his diſpenſation? 4. Hath not he promiſed, that if we patiently ſubmit to our trial, and <hi>accept of the puniſhment of our iniquity,</hi> (as the phraſe is, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.) he <hi>will do us good?</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Levit. 26.</note> Is this the way to cure our grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, to run into further evils; and becauſe the body is afflicted, to hurt the ſoul? Is not this, when God hath made us ſick, to make the devil our Phyſitian? Oh let us <hi>in patience poſſeſs our ſouls, Kiſs the rod,</hi> and wait the iſſue which God will give to our temptation.</p>

            <p>To begin with the firſt, <hi>And he ſaid unto her.</hi> Have Angels tongues?

            <p>Well, it will be then asked, how this Angel did ſpeak to <hi>Hagar?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is anſwered, <hi>in corpore aſſumpto,</hi> in a body aſſumed, that was
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41147:69"/> framed for him for this negotiation: in ſuch bodies aſſumed Angels did truly and really ſit down, and walk, and remove from place to place; did truly eat meat ſet before them, and did truly ſpeak, ſo that their words were audible and intelligible to thoſe with whom they had to deal; though there be great diſpute, <hi>de colloquio Angelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum inter ſe:</hi> how one Angel doth communicate his conceptions unto another; yet there is no doubt made of the truth of imparting themſelves to men and women in bodies aſſumed. That which may be obſerved hence, is that which we touched but in one word, the laſt time; and that is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The condeſcention of the Angels to the ſervice of man, for his good.</hi>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Angels in aſſuming bodies, and ſo ſpeaking and converſing with them, did comply with mens neceſſity; for if the people could not look upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> when God put that ſplendour upon him, till he vailed himſelf; men could endure much leſs, the glory and ſplendor of Angels, if they were not cloathed with a body: when they have thus appeared, it hath ſtriken a great terrour into people; <hi>Gideon</hi> thought verily, upon the appearing of the Angel unto him, he ſhould dye, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. and ſo thought <hi>Manoah</hi> the father of <hi>Samſon:</hi>

            <p>Now to ſhut up this point:</p>
            <p>If the ſight of an Angel be too <hi>excellens ſenſibile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Application</note> too excellent an object, which we ſay, <hi>deſtruit ſenſum,</hi> that it deſtroyeth the ſence; how unable ſhould we be to behold God! we ſhould be oppreſſed with his glory.

               <hi>I know their thoughts even now</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>what he will do, before I bring him into the land which I ſware.</hi> And if Angels or Men may come to know the thoughts of men, yet there is a broad difference between Gods knowledge and theirs: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, he knoweth them of himſelf; they, by revelation from him: So <hi>Samuel</hi> could tell <hi>Saul all that was in his heart:</hi>

            <p>Secondly, it may be fit for thoſe that have power of reproof of others, when they ſee them lifted up above that which is meet, to abate the tumour, by remembring them of their condition.

And thus he would ballaſt him, that, like a tottering veſſel, he ſhould not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. Yea, when we ſee in men a ſpiritual pride, in regard of inward endowments, we are to minde them of their natural corruption: that Jebuſite that will ſtill dwell within them, they are <hi>fleſh,</hi> as well as <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> and, by means of that, if they have <hi>laudem,</hi> they have <hi>Iahem;</hi> their defects as well as their deſerts; and their beſt actions are imperfect; and if the Lord <hi>ſhould be extreme to mark what is done amiſs,</hi> they were never able to <hi>abide it.</hi> And again, to tell them, that, if they conceit too highly of themſelves, they are <hi>blinde, and poor, and naked,</hi> as Chriſt told the Church of <hi>Laodicea:</hi> yea, that God is better pleaſed <hi>humilitate in malis, quàm ſuperbia in bonis;</hi> with humility in evil, then with pride in goodneſs: that he likes better a <hi>poor,</hi> then a proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; an humble Publican, then a boaſting Phariſee. Thus the pot

            <p>Yet further:</p>
            <p>There being a reproof couched in theſe words, as you have heard, and ſo you will finde in the words following: yet we may ſee, in this milde compellation, it is a Pill wrapt up in Sugar: The Angel doth not take her up in bitter terms; Now, you Run-away, what do you here? your proud ſpirit muſt needs riſe up againſt your miſtreſs, that had done you ſo much favour: and when ſhe did chaſtiſe you for deſpiſing of her, you muſt take you to your heels.

            <p>Let this be practiſed, to bring men to be humble;<note place="margin">Application</note> let us make them ſenſible of what they have loſt. I dare appeal to the ſad experience of many a Chriſtian, who having been carried into ſome evil courſe, by the ſtrength of tentation, and there kept by the power of Satan; how, when he hath come to recollect himſelf, he hath mourned for the comfort he hath formerly enjoyed: he apprehended Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; now he ſeeth his face clouded towards him: he had joy in his ſpirit; now there is heavineſs: he took delight in God ſervice; now he is dead unto it: he could come with boldneſs to the throne of grace; now he is afraid to appear before God: he had peace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; now nothing but diſturbance. Had he not known ſo much of Gods comforts, this preſent ſtate could not have been ſo troubleſom; but now he mourneth and weepeth, and crieth out, with <hi>David,</hi> to be <hi>reſtored to his former joy,</hi> and he will <hi>never more return to folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Quere is, <hi>Whither goeſt thou?</hi> What way canſt thou make for thy ſelf, in this deſolate place, in this vaſt wilderneſs? Nay, certainly the Angel knew that ſhe was minded to return into <hi>Egypt,</hi> her own country; and therefore, in the Quere, he would inſinuate the danger that ſhe caſts her ſelf into: as if he had ſaid, Thou haſt ill provided for thy body, by thy forſaking of thy miſtreſs houſe: for there is nothing to be expected here, but hunger and death: But thou haſt worſe provided for thy ſoul. Haſt thou left the Church of God, to return to that wicked place again? Wert thou in mercy reſcued from that idolatrous country, to return to thy former vomit.

            </p>
            <p>Now the qualification of this confeſſion is evident in many places of ſcripture; as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that it muſt be hearty, (that is) with a feeling of the burthen of ſin, as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 38. <hi>My ſins are gone over mine head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 38.4.</note> 
               <hi>and are too heavy a burthen for me to bear;</hi> yea with a bleeding heart,<note place="margin">Ezra. 9.6.</note> as the ſame <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. yea, with ſorrow and indignation, as <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9. <hi>O my God! I am aſhamed and confounded to lift up my face unto thee; for our iniquities are increaſed over our heads:</hi> ſo did <hi>Job</hi> abhorr himſelf, <hi>and repent in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Job. 42.6. and the Publican for ſhame <hi>durſt not lift up his eyes to Heaven;</hi> and in indignation againſt himſelf <hi>he ſmote his breaſt,</hi> Luk. 18.13. <hi>Saul</hi> will ſay he <hi>hath ſinned;</hi> but yet he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſo much to have a ſence of his ſin, as of his diſcredit, <hi>honour
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41147:76"/> me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, confeſſion muſt be with an honeſt heart, that is joyned with unfeigned hatred of ſin, and reſolution to leave it: <hi>Shekaniah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Ezra. 10.2.3.</note> 
               <hi>We have treſpaſſed againſt our God, and taken ſtrange wives, now let us make a covenant with God to put away theſe ſtrange wives: What have It do with Idols any more</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28.13.</note> Hoſ. 14.) and Prov. 28. <hi>He that confeſſeth his ſins, and forſaketh them, ſhall finde mercy:</hi> Some men confeſs their ſins, and yet continue them; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an ample confeſſion,<note place="margin">Exod. 9.27.</note> 
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. and yet at the 34. Verſ. It is ſaid, <hi>He ſinned yet more, and hardened his heart:</hi> And <hi>Saul</hi> confeſſed his ſin againſt <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. and yet purſueth him as eagerly as before. And ſo many of thoſe of the Church of Rome, after confeſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their ſins; yea even by confeſſion are emboldened unto it: even as the Drunkard vomiteth, that he may take in the more drink.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, confeſſion muſt be in faith and confidence of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; not as the fellon, to the judg, knowing he ſhall dye; but as the Patient to the Phyſitian,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.9.</note> hoping for cure: So <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>To thee O Lord God belongeth mercy and forgiveneſs, though we have rebelled againſt thee:</hi> and Ezra. 10.<note place="margin">Ezra. 10.2.</note> 
               <hi>We have tranſgreſſed againſt God, and have taken ſtrange wives; yet there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing;</hi> So the Prodigal. <hi>Cain</hi> confeſſeth his ſin, but deſpairing of mercy, Gen. 4.13. <hi>My ſin is greater then can he forgiven;</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> confeſſed he had <hi>ſinned in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying innocent blood;</hi> but yet it ſeems he diſtruſted pardon, and therefore <hi>went out and hang'd himſelfe.</hi> All theſe might be ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it is probable all theſe were in <hi>Hagar:</hi> She did confeſs with ſhame and ſorrow, and ſhe did reſolve never to run into the ſame er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour again; and ſhe hoped to finde mercy upon her confeſſion and ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>But that which is for our purpoſe, is a fourth qualification of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and that is, that it muſt be full without mincing of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, or byting in any thing; there is regard in this confeſſion, unto God; not only a confeſſion in groſs, but a particularizing, as we ſee in <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1 <hi>a Blaſphemer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.13.</note> 
               <hi>a perſecutor, an oppreſſour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, an aggravating of ſins; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſuppoſeth that the people will ſay,<note place="margin">1 King. 8.47.</note> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. <hi>We have ſinned, we have done perverſly; we have committed wickedneſs:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, we cannot expreſs how heinous our ſins are;<note place="margin">Act. 26.10.11, &amp;c.</note> So <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 26. <hi>Many of the Saints did I ſhut up in priſon: and when they were put to death, I gave my voyce againſt them; I puniſhed them often in their Synagogues, and compelled them to blaſpheme</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>And being exceedingly mad againſt them, I perſecuted them unto ſtrange cities.</hi> So Dan. 9.5, 6. <hi>We have ſinned, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly, and have rebelled.</hi> So <hi>Ezra,</hi> ch 9. Aggravateth the ſin of the people, as having been committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the manifold experiments, that they had both of the ſeverity and mercy of the Lord.<note place="margin">Mark. 14.10.</note> And it is ſaid of Saint <hi>Peter, Mark.</hi> 14. Weighing that with himſelf, <hi>he wept:</hi> weighing the circumſtances
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41147:76"/> by which his ſin was aggravated, he was ſoon melted into tears. This full confeſſion ſome underſtand by that phraſe, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Lam. 2.19.</note> of <hi>pouring out the heart like water before the face of the Lord:</hi> pouring out, and that the heart, and that like water: Not like oil; for then ſome of the ſubſtance would remain: nor like milk, for then ſome of the colour would remain: nor like wine; for then ſome of the taſte and relliſh would remain: But like water; where every drop goeth out, and not ſo much as the colour is left; but the veſſel is even as though nothing had been in it.</p>
            <p>But now for the Uſe of this.</p>
            <p>How far, firſt,<note place="margin">Application</note> are people from this ingenuous confeſſion of their ſins? They will deny flatly that they have done ſuch or ſuch things. God asketh <hi>Cain</hi> where his brother is, that he might bring him to confeſſion; and he ſaith, he knoweth not. There is in his anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Defectus veritatis,</hi> a defect of the truth: he lyeth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Charitatis,</hi> the want of charity: he is not bound to be his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers keeper.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Humilitatis,</hi> a failure of humility: mark how peremptory he is, to the face of God himſelf, to retort an interrogation; <hi>Am I my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers keepe?</hi> Thus <hi>Sarah</hi> denied that ſhe had laughed: and <hi>Gehazi,</hi> when his maſter asketh him whence he came, he ſaith, <hi>Thy ſervant went no whither.</hi> Thus <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> denied that which they had done.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if people cannot deny, they will juſtifie their evil acts. <hi>Saul</hi> will not, a good while, be beaten off, but that he hath <hi>obeyed the voice of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Jonah,</hi> when God challenged him for being angry, he ſaith, he <hi>doth well to be angry, yea to the death.</hi> And the ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> in ſtead of confeſſing their fault, ſay, they have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which was fitting, for the reſcue of the honour of their family.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if they cannot juſtifie it, they will excuſe and extenuate it; and ſo, like the unjuſt ſteward, ſet down <hi>fifty</hi> for an <hi>hundred:</hi> And they will leſſen the fault, ſometimes by the good intention, as <hi>Saul</hi> would his ſparing the Amalekites goods, by his purpoſe of a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Sometimes by the examples of others: they can tell how <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> lyed, and <hi>Noah</hi> was exceſſive, and <hi>David</hi> failed, and <hi>Peter deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and they have but done the like: Nay, they can ſay, though they have done thus and thus; yet they are not ſo bad as others: <hi>God, I thank thee, I am not as other men are, nor at this publican,</hi> Luke 18.<note place="margin">Luke 18.11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, if this will not do, they will tranſlate the fault from themſelves, upon the corruption of nature; and ſay, as Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>It is no more I</hi> that do it, <hi>but ſin that dwelleth in me.</hi> Alas, he ſpeaketh of infirmities that are mental. 2. He maintained a fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fleſh: whereas theſe men would put off foul and groſs ſins to the fleſh, and ſuch as they no way oppoſe: how can they, when they are all fleſh? Sometimes they tranſlate their ſin upon the Times,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41147:77"/> and places where they live: But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would have men <hi>redeem the time, becauſe the days are evil:</hi> and there have been ſome godly men in the worſt places. Sometimes upon occaſions that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whereas there is no trial of vertue, but by ſuch occaſions. Sometimes upon Satan; whereas, though he can <hi>ſuadere,</hi> he cannot <hi>cogere;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note> though he can tempt, he cannot compel, (ſaith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine;) non extorquet conſenſum, ſed petit;</hi> he cannot enforce conſent of us, but begs it. Sometime upon God himſelf: <hi>The woman that thou gaveſt me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Adam:</hi> But <hi>let no man ſay,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>James) when he is tempted, that he is tempted of God;</hi> for <hi>he is drawn away by his own concupiſcence.</hi> Sometime upon their brethren, and their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: ſo <hi>Aaron</hi> would caſt his fault upon the tumultuouſneſs of the people: and the Fathers ſay as much for him; <hi>Tumultuantibus populi clamoribus ceſsit;</hi> that he gave way to the impetuous clamours of the people: But that is a fig-leaf too narrow to cover his nakedneſs. And ſo <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid, he <hi>feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</hi> And <hi>Pilate</hi> thought to caſt all upon the violence of the people, or the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the commands of others. I might be much larger in this way.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note>By all this, ſee, how true that of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is; <hi>Quod malum eſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus eſſe noſtrum;</hi> that what is evil, we would not have to be ours: we are content to act ſin, but we are loath to own it. But how vain all this is, and how fruitleſs, conſidering we have to deal, in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with the All-ſeeing God, who ſearcheth the hearts and reins, and knows us better then we do our ſelves; let any man judge.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, therefore, if we will confeſs our ſins, (as we muſt do) let us deal ingenuouſly; let us not hide or palliate them. Some people have diſeaſes about them, that they are loath to reveal: but, <hi>Plus memores pudoris, quàm ſalutis,</hi> (ſaith the Father;) they are more mindful of their ſhame, then of their health. And ſo people, in the acknowledgement of their ſin, will not ſpeak out. Do they think thus to conceal it? or do they think God will ſhame them for their open dealing? Oh no! While we deal apertly, he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to cover, and caſt a mantle over them. We may conceal our tranſgreſſions; but it will not be from his knowledge, but to our own woful prejudice.</p>
            <p>Here further we may obſerve, the notable effect of affliction:
<q>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>3.</hi> The notable and good effects of well-improved affliction.</note>When God is pleaſed to awaken the conſcience thereby, then there is a free acknowledgement, and ſerious humiliation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This we ſee in <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren; we know of what an unnatural act they were guilty; their conſcience troubled them not for it, for a long time: but at laſt, being in a great perplexity in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned for no leſs then treaſon, their conſcience awaketh, and they reflect with grief upon that foul fact of theirs,<note place="margin">Gen. 42.21.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. And thus it was with <hi>Manaſſeh;</hi> when he came to be in fetters, then he awaked, and humbled himſelf in the preſence of God.<note place="margin">Job 36.8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Job</hi> 36.)
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41147:77"/> 
               <hi>If they be bound in fetters, and tied with the cords of affliction; then will he ſhew them their work, and their ſin;</hi> becauſe they have been proved. In the glaſs of affliction, a man ſeeth himſelf fully: yea, thoſe errours that lay dormant in proſperity, will come then within his view; as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, that in his trouble he did <hi>poſſeſs the ſins of his youth;</hi> his looſe <hi>olims</hi> came then to his remembrance. And ſo much we may gather from that ſpeech of the <hi>Sareptan</hi> widow to <hi>Eliſha; Why art thou come to call my ſins to remembrance, and to ſlay my ſon?</hi> 1 Kings 17.<note place="margin">1 Kings 17.18.</note> Then doth God ſet our ſins in order before us, and make that regiſter, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to produce many a forgotten ſin. And thus it was with the Prodigal; his affliction made him ſee his errour, and whipped him home unto his fathers houſe. <hi>Before I was afflicted,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I went wrong: but now I have learned thy ſtatutes.</hi> And therefore it is moſt ſure, that <hi>vexatio dat intellectum;</hi> affliction teacheth underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Schola Crucis, ſchola Lucis;</hi> the croſs is the ſchool of light. And Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith ſweetly, <hi>Oculos quos culpa claudit, poena aperit;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Gregory.</note> puniſhment openeth thoſe eyes which ſin ſhutteth: It is like the clay and ſpittle that Chriſt applied to the eyes of the blinde man, by which he recovered his ſight.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>Firſt, it muſt teach us to juſtifie God in his proceedings, when,<note place="margin">Application</note> in ſtead of ſmiling, he frowns upon us; in ſtead of proſpering us, he doth afflict us. It is true, he <hi>doth not afflict willingly,</hi> Lam. 3.33. nay, in his peoples affliction, <hi>he is afflicted,</hi> Iſai. 63.9. <hi>he delighteth in mercy,</hi> Micah 7.18. and the execution of judgement is <hi>opus alienum,</hi> his <hi>ſtrange work,</hi> Iſai. 28.21. But there is a neceſſity of it: <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, I will melt them, and try them: for how ſhould I do for the daughter of my people?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, How ſhould I ſave them? how ſhould I keep them from periſhing everlaſtingly, if I ſhould not correct them? <hi>Now for a ſeaſon, if need be,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. <hi>you are in heavineſs, through many temptations.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, You ſhould not be in heavineſs, no not for that ſhort ſeaſon, if there were not need: but the droſs will not be purged out, without this fire; the ruſt gotten off, without this file; nor the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours purged out, without this ſharp doſe: you would not be ſanctified here, or ſaved hereafter, without this. And therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, that God, of his exceeding <hi>goodneſs, cauſed him to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>when we are judged, we are chaſtiſed of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſhould teach us to examine, whether the affliction that God ſends upon us, have this effect in us; whether our conſcie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are awaked in this ſtorm, as <hi>Jonahs</hi> was; whether it bring our ſins to minde; whether it makes us <hi>ſearch and try our ways,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 3.</note> as it is <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. and maketh us <hi>ſift our ſelves,</hi> as it is <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. and bethink our ſelves of former errours, that we may purge them out by humiliation. We have not the firſt degree of profiting by affliction, unleſs we ſee our
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41147:78"/> ſin. Yea, we ſhould labour to finde out the <hi>Achan,</hi> the main cauſe of our trouble, and beg of God to ſhew wherefore he woundeth us; and with <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 10.2. And 13.23.</note> (Chap. 10.) to ſhew us our <hi>rebellion</hi> and our <hi>ſin.</hi> A fearful thing it is, when a man ſhall be in their caſe that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Jer. 10.6. Ezek. 16.43.</note> Chap. 10.6. <hi>No man ſaid, What have I done?</hi> and of thoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>I have brought thy way upon thine own head, yet haſt thou not conſideration of thine abominations.</hi> A man to be afflicted, and to have no ſenſe of ſin; to have his heart in him as <hi>Nabals, like a ſtone,</hi> no conſideration of the cauſe, moſt woful.</p>
            <p>But now come to the next verſe, which containeth the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Angel gives to <hi>Hagar,</hi> to return to her miſtreſs, and to humble her ſelf under her hand. And here, firſt, we may obſerve the goodneſs of God toward this woman; that whereas ſhe was haſtening to her own wo, and in the high-way to ruine her ſoul, by going into idolatrous <hi>Egypt;</hi> God keepeth her from this precipice, and ſuffereth her to go no further.</p>
            <q>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>4.</hi> 'Tis a mercy of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from evil.</note>It is a great mercy of God, to be reſtrained from evil.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>I kept thee</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Abimelech) that thou ſhouldst not ſin againſt me,</hi> Gen. 20.6. God kept the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> from ſhedding of the blood of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> by that perſwaſion of <hi>Reuben.</hi> God kept <hi>David</hi> from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting his reſolution againſt the houſe of <hi>Nabal:</hi> he had committed a fearful ſin, if, in his rage and fury, he had acted what he had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And when he had <hi>Saul</hi> in the cave, and that all opportunity did ſmile upon him, yea invite him to take revenge upon his well-known adverſary that ſought his life; God kept him from imbruing his hands in the blood of the Lords Anointed. How many have we known, that when they have been bound upon this and that deſigne, ſomething hath intervened, that hath taken them off, and kept them from doing that which they purpoſed; which was Gods care and providence over them, to prevent their ſin, and not to ſuffer them to be ſo bad as they would have been.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Let us, every of us, account it a mercy, and bleſs God for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace: we have the ſeed of all ſin in us; yet there are ſome ſins that we never felt the leaſt inclination unto; as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, he never knew that he had the leaſt motion to covetouſneſs: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when one thought fit, for the ſtopping of his mouth, he ſhould be tempted with gold, it was anſwered by another, <hi>Germana illa be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia non curat aurum;</hi> that that ſame German beaſt cared not for gold. So, many a man is never ſo much as tempted to theft, or ſodomy, or murder: this is Gods mercy, that he ſhould thus keep them down, and caſt them, as it were, into a ſleep; as he did <hi>Saul,</hi> and thoſe that were about him,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 26.</note> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. It is not, that we are naturally better then others, that every luſt doth not bubble up in us: we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it is Gods mercy that keepeth them down, and conſider <hi>who it is that maketh us to differ,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in another caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.7.</note>
            </p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:41147:78"/>
            <p>Secondly, we have had motions and temptations to this and that ſin, that others have fallen into; but they have not prevailed with us, to the commiſſion of them. And what hath been the cauſe that we have not hatched theſe Cockatrice-eggs, and that they have not come to a fiery flying ſerpent? Certainly, God hath reſtrained us; he could eaſily have <hi>given us up to our own hearts luſts,</hi> as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.<note place="margin">Pſal. 81.12.</note> and have ſaid to our corruptions, as he did to the deceiving ſpirit that went to <hi>Ahab, Go, and prevail,</hi> 1 Kings 22. but he hath kept us: it is his goodneſs, and we muſt acknowledge it with all thankfulneſs. When we hear men engaged in theſe foul ſins of Idolatry, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Blaſphemy, and Oppreſſion; we muſt pity them, and thank God for preſerving us, who elſe ſhould be as bad as the worſt. It was a pious minde in Saint <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> he would praiſe God; <hi>pro pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis quae fecit, and quae non fecit;</hi> both for the ſins he had committed, and had not committed; for the remiſſion of the former, and the prevention of the later. I obſerve ſometimes, that people, being reſolved upon this and that wickedneſs, and being prevented of the perfecting of it, by the failing of ſome inſtrument or opportunity, or ſome ſickneſs, or inability in themſelves, that they chaſe and fret. Oh that their eyes were but opened, to ſee what a mercy this is, that they murmure at; how good a friend God is to them, while they are their own enemies! They would ruine their ſouls, and God will not ſuffer them. That holy Father could ſay, <hi>Utiliter vincitur, cui peccandi licentia eripitur:</hi> He is happily conquered, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from ſin; yea, though God ſtop his way with thorns, and by ſome heavie-armed affliction on him: for, by this means, though the body ſuffer, yet the ſoul may be ſaved. On the other ſide, it is the greateſt judgement that God can lay upon a man, on this ſide hell, to let him thrive in ſin; when he ſaith, as to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> in <hi>Hoſea,</hi>

            <p>We now come to the direction it ſelf, which conſiſteth of two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſhe muſt return to her miſtris.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſhe muſt humble her ſelf, under her hand.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſhe muſt return. <hi>Muſculus</hi> moveth the queſtion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Muſculus</hi> in locum.</note> why the Angel would have her return; ſeeing after a while, ſhe was to be caſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41147:79"/> out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe? And he anſwereth; that firſt, it was a conſiderable time, that ſhe ſtayed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family; even till her ſon was grown: he was fourteen years older then <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and after <hi>Jſaac</hi> was born, his mother and he ſtaid ſo long, till <hi>Iſaac</hi> and he could play together; and he could mock <hi>Iſaac:</hi> (as appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.<note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note>) which was the cauſe of his ejectment. For the injunction, there might be ſomething obſerved out of it, (if it had not been before touched:)</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>5.</hi> Dominion and ſervitude ſtand well with chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty.</note>As firſt, That he would have her return: therefore he condemns her flight. This we ſpoke of before; and ſhewed, that the flight of ſervants, upon ill uſage by their maſters or miſtreſſes, was unlawful.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſaith here, return to thy miſtris; as juſtifying the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God hath ſet in the world;<note place="margin">A briefe reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on Serm. j. Obſerv. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note> of government, and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Some muſt be maſters, and others in the condition of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: of this we have ſpoken heretofore, largely; and ſhewed that by the commandement that God hath given to maſters, to govern their ſervants, (both in the old and new teſtament:) by the many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections he hath given both to maſters and ſervants, for their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: (as appeareth in <hi>Moſes, Solomon</hi>'s And the Apoſtles writings:) by the examples of Saints and holy men, that have been, ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſome ſervants; by the rewards propounded both to maſters and ſervants, upon the conſcionable performance of their duty; it appeareth, that God approveth of the condition of ſervants: and therefore the Anabaptiſts are but vain, in their objections againſt it. They ſay, that it is againſt nature, for one to be ſervant to another: <hi>ſervuus nomen non naturae ſed culpae,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtin;</hi> Servant is a name, not of nature, but of ſin and puniſhment; be it ſo, that it is againſt perfect nature, and the ſtate of innocency, wherein there ſhould not have been That <hi>dominium deſpoticum,</hi> that maſterly power, that is now exerciſed; yet it is not againſt that courſe of nature, wherein God hath now ſetled man: God hath turned ſome puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin, into bounden duties; as ſubjection of the wife to the husband, and mans eating his bread in the ſweat of his browes: But again ſay they, it is againſt grace, and that liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed; but I ſay it is not; for Chriſt hath ſet us free from the ceremoniall law, and from the curſe and rigour of the morall law, and from Satan, ſin, death and damnation; but not from that order, and thoſe degrees, which he hath eſtabliſhed in the world. But we are all one in Chriſt (ſay they;) there is neither bond nor free: True, as they are members of Chriſts ſpiritual Body; but not as they are members of a politick Body: a politick inequality, is not againſt a ſpirituall equality: <hi>Oneſimus</hi> is as good as <hi>Philemon</hi> in Chriſt; yet <hi>Oneſimus</hi> is <hi>Philemons</hi> ſervant: this kinde of reaſoning was in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Apoſtles time; ſervants preſumed upon their liberty by Chriſt; and therefore they would ſhake off the yoke of ſubjection, eſpecially to the aliens: But we ſhall ſee how earneſt the Apoſtles are, to put
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41147:79"/> ſtrength in This; and tell them that their ſpirituall eſtate, may not diſſolve civil order, but they muſt be ſubject to their maſters, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chriſtian or heathen, ſo long as they were ſervants, even for conſcience ſake; but no more of this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, humble thy ſelf under her hand. This is harſher then the former: Gods commands lye not alwayes in ſmooth wayes; they charge that which is contrary to our corrupt diſpoſition, but they muſt be obeyed; though it be to the pulling out of the right eye, and to the cutting off of the right hand: but we will defer this, till we come to ſhew how <hi>Hagar</hi> performed This which the Angell injoyned her: In the mean time we muſt obſerve, that ſhe had been guilty of faults.</p>
            <p>Firſt, flying from her miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, inſolency towards her miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Now the Angell fitteth the medicine unto both theſe maladies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſhe muſt make amends, for her flight, by her returning.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſhe muſt humble her ſelf under her miſtreſſes hand,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>6.</hi> Satisfaction for offences, how to be rendred both to God and man.</note> to make amends for her inſolency: and here might be obſerved, that ſatisfaction is to be given to ſuch, whom we have offended; we muſt confeſs our fault, and crave their pardon, and carry our ſelves fairly towards them for after time: we ſee it was done by <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and it is that which our Saviour approveth: that if our brother have any thing againſt us, we ſhould be reconciled unto him; which cannot be done without confeſſion, and ſubmiſſion: And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> undertaketh <hi>for Oneſimus,</hi> that he ſhall return and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his fault, and be ever after a faithfull ſervant. This is a bitter pill to many men: when they have done wrong, they are loath to confeſs it, or to ſeek pardon for it; but if they ſhall not do it, they ſhall finde, that as they are ſtill debtors to men, ſo they are to God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and incur his wrath, by not obeying this commandement of God. But I will conclude with that which is required of men, in regard of God: as they have gone away from him by their ſin, ſo they muſt return unto him; and as they have lifted up themſelves, in the pride of their hearts, againſt him,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.6.</note> ſo they muſt humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under his hand: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Firſt we muſt return. How often are ſinners call'd upon by the Prophets; <hi>Return unto the Lord:</hi> the Father allegorizeth that place of the wiſe men, returning into their country another way; the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that hath gone out by the way of uncleanneſs, he muſt return by the way continency; if by the way of exceſs, he muſt return by the way of temperance: if by the way of pride, he muſt return by the way of humility: Return we muſt, for the longer we keep off from God, the worſe we are: like to <hi>Abſalon,</hi> who having offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his father, fled to <hi>Geſhur,</hi> and there ſtayed three yeares.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.38.</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. But we muſt return to our father, as the prodigall did.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt humble our ſelves under his hand; we muſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41147:80"/> confeſs our fault with grief and ſhame; and we muſt acknowledg his juſtneſs, in the affliction that he layeth upon us; juſtifie him and condemn our ſelves, and accept of the puniſhment of our iniquity? as it is,<note place="margin">Levit. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. And we muſt earneſtly beg his pardon, and vow better obedience towards him: and all this we muſt do ingenuouſly; as it is here, we muſt humble our ſelves: there be many that be <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliati, ſed non humiles;</hi> humbled, but not humble; as we ſee in <hi>Ahab:</hi> many have their hearts broke, and yet their ſtomack is not broken. But we muſt freely and willingly humble our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. And as the word here uſed, is in the conjugation <hi>Hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pael,</hi> and ſignifieth a continuation of the <hi>Act: Hagar</hi> muſt humble her ſelf; yea and continue humble, all the time ſhe ſtayeth with her miſtris. So muſt it be with us, having after offending God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto him; and having confeſſed our ſins, and begged pardon, and vowed obedience; we muſt continue humble, and ſo in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility walk with our God, and provoke him no more. We ſee in too many that <hi>optimi dum infirmi</hi> (as he ſaid;) when God hath met with them in ſome affliction, they ſeek God, and confeſs their ſin, and beg pardon, and a releaſ from the judgment: but after a while they grow proud againſt God, and provoke him; and have forgotten the dayes of their preſſure. But it ought not to be ſo, my dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: we muſt make conſcience of walking in an humble courſe (after our deliverances,) and an endeavouring to pleaſe God ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for elſe there may be juſt reaſon to queſtion all our former hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; and fear for the time to come, of ſome further meaſure of indignation; for we know who it was that ſaid, <hi>ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe be the three ſorts of words that the Angel uſeth to <hi>Hagar,</hi> words of prediction.</p>
            <p>And firſt, he foretelleth the multiplication of her ſeed, verſ. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the name of her ſon that ſhe ſhould bear, who was to be the root of ſo numerous an iſſue, <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> together with the reaſon of his name, verſe 11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, his quality and condition: <hi>He ſhall be a wilde man: his hand ſhall be againſt every man, and every mans hand againſt him;</hi> and yet of that power, that he ſhould dwell <hi>in the preſence of all his brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I come to theſe particulars, give me leave to obſerve, in general, Here is a great comfort propounded to <hi>Hagar;</hi> but the Angel gave her not this comfort, till ſhe had been humbled. And this is Gods manner of dealing;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt to humble them, and then to comfort them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>1.</hi> God and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters method is firſt to humble people, and then to comfort them.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So it was in the former Chapter, (verſ. 12.) with <hi>Abraham; an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of great darkneſs fell upon him,</hi> and after that, God ſpeaketh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably unto him. So <hi>Jacob</hi> was in great diſtreſs and perplexity, through the news of his brothers coming towards him; and then the Angel of the Lord cometh unto him, and wreſtleth with him, and aſſureth him of protection, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.<note place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> And ſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> is in great trouble, and afterwards lifted up. And ſo <hi>Moſes,</hi> and divers others.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak of that which we eſpecially intend:</p>
            <p>The ſoul God will have humbled in the ſight of ſin, and ſorrow for it, before he comfort it.</p>
            <p>This we ſee in <hi>David;</hi> he confeſſeth and mourneth, before God ſpeaks peace unto him. And ſo it was with <hi>Manaſſeh;</hi> he is firſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for his ſin, and then he is refreſhed with comfort. God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to reſtore comfort to the <hi>mourners,</hi> Iſai. 57. they mourn firſt,<note place="margin">Iſai. 57.18.</note> and then they have comfort. And when our Lord ſaith,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.4.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn; for they ſhall be comforted;</hi> (Matth. 5.) he ſheweth the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41147:81"/> manner of Gods proceeding. And the like we ſee, in that ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of his, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavie laden; and I will refreſh you:</hi> We muſt finde ſin a burden, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will eaſe us. The woman that was <hi>a ſinner in the city,</hi> was humbled, before Chriſt told her, that her ſins were <hi>forgiven</hi> her. And ſo it was with that poor traveller,<note place="margin">Luke 10.13.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 10. he is wounded, before the good Samaritan comes and cures him. And ſo it was with Saint <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. he was humbled, and lay in great perplexity a good while, before God ſends <hi>Ananias</hi> unto him. And the Jaylor was caſt down in the ſight of his ſin, before he was raiſed up by ſpiritual comfort, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>And certainly, this courſe that God takes, is full of wiſdom: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, God looketh there ſhould be a receptivity, a fitting capacity in that heart that he means to comfort: nay, he ſhould but throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his comfort, if the ſubject be not prepared. The earth muſt be plowed, before the ſeed be committed to it: the wax muſt be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, before it will receive impreſſion: the veſſel muſt be cleanſed, before the ſweet liquor be put into it.<note place="margin">Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; (ſaith <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen;</hi>) Who puts precious ointment into an unſavoury veſſel? The ſeed ſeemeth but loſt, to be thrown upon the unbroken earth. And to what purpoſe, to ſet the ſeal upon wax that is hard? And unleſs the veſſel be rinſed, and made clean, the ſweet water, that is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, is ſpoiled. And ſo, unleſs the heart be humbled, comforts are caſt away; they cannot be received.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God intendeth, that thoſe whom he will refreſh, ſhould finde ſweetneſs in his comforts:<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.8.</note> 
               <hi>Taſte and ſee how gracious he is,</hi> Pſal. 34. but it is preceding humiliation, that muſt work this relliſh; even as we ſee, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt frigora, dulcior ignis;</hi> fire is the more chearing, after cold; and after a dark lowring night, the clear morning is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable:<note place="margin">S. Baſil.</note> And, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (ſaith Saint <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil;</hi>) Faſting and abſtinence ſauceth beſt the uſe of meats: And, <hi>to the hungry ſoul,</hi> even <hi>a bitter thing is ſweet,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi>) And <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> ſaith of Health,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
               <hi>Magis placet reddita, quàm retenta;</hi> that 'tis more apprehended, and more joyed in, being reſtored, then when not interrupted.

            <p>Thirdly, God intendeth, that men ſhould make much of thoſe comforts that he hath given them, and preſerve them: Now they cannot be ſo chary and ſo choice in the keeping of them, unleſs they have had, firſt, a ſenſe of the want of them: the receiving of them, after much longing for them, maketh men fearful, (by any miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages) to loſe or forfeit them.<note place="margin">Pſal. 85.8.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. God <hi>will ſpeak to his people, and to his Saints;</hi> with this intention, <hi>that they ſhall return no more unto folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:41147:81"/>
            <p>The Uſe of this is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, to us that be the Miniſters, and you that are the people: To us,<note place="margin">Application</note> in the ſpeaking comforts, and to you, in the receiving of them. We muſt not comfort, before we ſee you humbled for your ſins. God giveth his Miniſters <hi>the tongue of the learned, to miniſter a word in due ſeaſon:</hi> but to whom? <hi>to him that is weary,</hi> Iſai. 50. We muſt,<note place="margin">Iſai. 50.4.</note> like the good Samaritan, pour in, firſt <hi>wine,</hi> and then <hi>oil:</hi> we muſt purge by Potion, and then comfort by Cordial: we muſt uſe, firſt, <hi>verbera,</hi> the ſtripes of the Law; and then draw out <hi>uhera,</hi> the breſts of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I know that people are greedy of comforts, and, like the ſons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> they would have a grant of ſitting on the <hi>right hand, and left,</hi> in Chriſts Kingdom, before ever they have <hi>drank of the cup that he did drink of,</hi> or have been <hi>baptized with his baptiſm:</hi> they ſend for the Miniſter, and deſire him to give it them; but diſcover not any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of humiliation, upon which to ground this comfort. Now, if we ſhould ſatisfie them in this, we ſhould be unfaithful to our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and bad ſtewards of that allowance which he giveth us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe; yea, it may be, we might be guilty of giving <hi>childrens bread</hi> unto <hi>dogs.</hi> And as we ſhould be unfaithful to God, ſo we ſhould be helpleſs to men; we ſhould do them no good with comforts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not diſpoſed for them by humiliation: nay, we ſhould do them much harm: for the great Maſter of Phyſick telleth us, that,<note place="margin">Hippocrates.</note> in an impure body, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>omne nutritivum eſt nocivum;</hi> that which nouriſheth, hurteth. There muſt be firſt an evacuation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, where there is Plethory; and then nouriſhing things do well. As we muſt be, therefore, careful, in our way, to give every one the portion of meat <hi>in due ſeaſon;</hi> ſo, do not you require com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of us, till you come to a ſight of your ſins, and have true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe in your ſouls for them.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Uſe may be this, even to abate the joy of ſome people in the world, who brag of thoſe comforts that they have in themſelves, and perſwaſion that they have of their good condition; and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, that they have been truely and ſenſibly caſt down for their ſins. I may ſay, <hi>Their rejoycing is not good,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.) in another caſe: They may ſuſpect ſuch a building, as hath no better a foundation: They may juſtly fear, that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is not of God, becauſe they have it not according to Gods order and method: For, on whom hath he ever beſtowed <hi>the ſpirit of adoption,</hi> who have not firſt had <hi>the ſpirit of bondage?</hi> What ſpirit hath ever God raiſed, that he hath not firſt, in ſome meaſure, caſt down? I ſay, In ſome meaſure: for I know, the ſame meaſure of humiliation is not required of all. As there may be in the ſoul falſe fears; (Satan hath his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (as the Greek Father calls them;<note place="margin">S. Chryſoſtom.</note>) his vizards, to terrifie people withal; and to make them fear, when there is no juſt cauſe of fear:) ſo there may be falſe joys; and people may
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41147:82"/> triumph in ſome comforts, that yet are not the joy of the Spirit: Remember we it every of us; True joy in the Chriſtian ſoul, riſeth out of ſorrow for ſin: And that is the trueſt conſolation, that we finde in our ſelves, after true humiliation.</p>
            <p>A Second thing is this. Here is a promiſe of a great bleſſing to this woman, but mark how it is inferred; even upon the direction that the Angell had given her in the former verſ: If ſhe ſhall return and humble her ſelf, under the hand of her miſtreſs; acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her fault,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>2.</hi> Gods promiſes run alwaies with condition of obedience: the defect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Nulleth his obligation. <hi>Deut. 8.29.</hi>
               </note> and carrying her ſelf fittingly for after time; then ſhe may expect the accompliſhment of that bleſſing, which the Angell here foretelleth: The promiſes of the bleſſings of God, run with a condition of our obedience: <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhall thou not be accepted</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.7.)

            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:41147:82"/>
            <p>For the Uſe of it:</p>
            <p>It meets, firſt, with a great many in the world, who are urging God with the performance of his promiſe; yea, and challenging him for not performance; while, in the mean time, they regard not at all the performance of the condition. What? do men think, that, having entered into Covenant with God, that he muſt be tied by his part, and not they by theirs? Muſt he be faſt, and muſt they be looſe? I wonder with what face they can complain of God, where they are conſcious to themſelves of their groſs and foul neglects, contrary to their vow in Baptiſm, contrary to their Covenant renewed in the Lords Supper, and contrary to many private engagements, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſome mercy experienced, or judgement feared or inflicted. I dare not think they are ſo deſperate, as to imagine that nothing is to be done on their part; that they make account to go to heaven in ſome whirlwinde; that the Kingdom of heaven will come with expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or that there is no more required, but ſome languid or faint wiſh, to make them happie; like that of <hi>Balaam; Let my ſoul die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his:</hi> that once being within the compaſs of the Church, (like paſſengers at ſea) they ſhall be brought to the haven, even ſleeping; like the <hi>lilies cloathed without ſpinning,</hi> and like the <hi>birds fed without ſowing.</hi> Certainly, they muſt think, that ſomething is to be done on their part: And if ſo, Why do they not do it? Why do they not <hi>ſtrive,</hi> that they may be <hi>crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> Why do they not <hi>run,</hi> that they may <hi>obtain?</hi> Why do they not fit themſelves for Gods bleſſing, by holy living? At leaſt, why are they not aſhamed to lay claim to the Obligation, when they have not performed the Condition? If they miſs what they would have, let them thank themſelves. God was, and is ſtill ready to do what he hath engaged himſelf; but we fall to obey his Commandments, and therefore fall ſhort of our hopes and expectations; and that we be forced to ſay, as <hi>Nehemiah, The Lord hath done righteouſly, but we have done wickedly;</hi> and as our Saviour; he <hi>would,</hi> but they <hi>would not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, let it teach us all, that, having a promiſe of bleſſings from God, we be careful to do what is required of us. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideranda eſt promiſsio, ſed conſideranda eſt conditio;</hi> the promiſe (ſaith one) is not more to be deſired, then the condition to be conſidered. The Apoſtle having mentioned, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end.</note> that God would <hi>dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and be their God, and they ſhould be his people;</hi> that <hi>he would be a father unto them, and they ſhould be his ſons and daughters:</hi> in the firſt verſe of the next Chapter, he ſaith, <hi>Having therefore theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs, both of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> Do we look to be made free by our Maſter, and not ſerve our time? Do we think to have our bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and not perform conditions? And do we think to have the good things of this life, and not walk in the fear of God? Surely we
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41147:83"/> may have ſomething, but not in mercy, and for eternal life. <hi>Vis eſſe beatus,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Application Againſt Merit.</note>And this may ſilence all conceit of Merit: God, of his good will, inviteth us by promiſes to do our duty; and ſhall we think the doing of our duty to be meritorious of that which God hath promiſed? Shall his encouragement be accounted a debt; and that (as they ſay) he cannot in juſtice deny the reward? It is true, he is a debtor, <hi>promittendo nobis,</hi> by promiſing ſomething to us; <hi>non accipiendo à
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41147:83"/> nobis,</hi> but not by receiving ought from us. We may in humility ſay, <hi>Da quod promiſiſti,</hi> Give us, Lord, what thou haſt promiſed; but we cannot ſtand upon terms, and ſay, <hi>Redde quod accepiſti,</hi> Reſtore what thou haſt received from us. Nay, he is ſo far from being any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to us for that which we do, that he is fain to help us to do our duty; to furniſh us with money, and help us to pay him his own debt. When he invites us to do our duty by a reward, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to perform that duty, which he in his mercy hath promiſed to reward; I bleſs my ſelf to think where merit ſhould creep in! Nay, I cannot but judge ſuch groſs contemners of the grace of God, and to merit eternal miſery, that cannot be content to be ſaved by Gods ſole mercy. If a man ſhould encourage thee, by promiſe of a reward, to do that which otherwiſe he might exact of thee, and that thou couldſt not do that thing without his aſſiſtance; were it not a groſs part in thee, to challenge that reward as a debt, and ſay, he were not juſt, if he did not pay it? This is the very caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us.</p>
            <p>But I paſs by this, and come to the ſubſtance of the verſe, which containeth the firſt prediction of the multiplication of her ſeed.</p>
            <p>But here it is queſtioned, how this party, being but an Angel of the Lord, could ſay, <hi>I will exceedingly multiply thy ſeed. Angelus ſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturum promittit, quod unius Dei proprium erat,</hi> (ſaith my Author;<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>4.</hi> God inveſteth his Angels and Meſſengers with his own Name and Authority, to ſet the higher rate upon them and their meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note>) the Angel here promiſeth to effect that, which is onely the proper work of the Almighty. But, (ſaith he) <hi>nihil obſtat,</hi> it is uſual in the Scripture, for the Angels to uſe the name of God; as that Angel ſaid to <hi>Gedeon, I will be with thee, and thou ſhalt ſmite the Midianites as one man,</hi> Judg. 1. becauſe God is pleaſed (ſaith he) <hi>inducere perſonam ſuam miniſtris quos mittit, quo magis conſtet verbo ſuo authoritas;</hi> to lend the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his perſon to thoſe meſſengers he ſendeth, that the greater may be the authority of his Word, which they deliver. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that divide the Word unto you, are Angels; and God inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them in a great power, and deriveth upon them his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; inſomuch that they are called <hi>Salvatores,</hi> no leſs then Saviours,<note place="margin">Obad. v. 21. 1. Tim. 4.10.</note> in <hi>Obad.</hi> verſ. 21. and they are ſaid to <hi>ſave,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. and yet <hi>ſalvation belongeth properly to the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 3.8.

Miniſters are ſaid to <hi>looſe and binde</hi> ſinners; which yet is the proper work of God: for none have power to forgive ſins, but God onely. They are ſaid to <hi>bleſs</hi> the people; and we know this is the proper work of God, and he is the God of bleſſing. Miniſters are his <hi>ambaſſadours;</hi> and we know what kinde of power is committed to ſuch kinde of Agents, by Princes.</p>
            <p>And therefore, in one word, for the Uſe of it:</p>
            <p>It ſhould raiſe the rate and eſtimation of Gods Meſſengers in our hearts: and when they ſpeak unto us in the name of the Lord,<note place="margin">Application</note> we
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41147:84"/> ſhould <hi>not receive it as the word of man, but as it is indeed the Word of God;</hi> which worketh effectually in all thoſe that believe. We look upon the perſons of Gods ſervants, but not upon their Office, and that authority wherewith God hath furniſhed them; and therefore, like the Phariſees,<note place="margin">Luke 7.30.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 7. we <hi>reject the counſel of God against our ſelves.</hi> But we ſhould know, that what the Miniſter faithfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth, by vertue of his Office, is to be received, as if God had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſpoken it: If we do not, we ſhall finde that true that our Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">Luke 10.16.</note>

            <p>What might be obſerved out of this manner of ſpeaking, I have heretofore touched; and therefore I ſay no more of it.</p>
            <p>But now here it is ſaid, <hi>I will multiply thy ſeed exceedingly.</hi>

            <p>And it is anſwered, It is, to diſtinguiſh the promiſed ſeed, which was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to be born of <hi>Sarah;</hi> and that childe which came of the handmaid, that was but the reſultance of a carnal device.

               <hi>I will multiply thy ſeed exceedingly.</hi> We ſee whoſe bleſſing Iſſue is; I will do it, ſaith God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from whence the Multiplication of iſſue is; and that it is a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>But both theſe I fully handled elſe where.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Here was a great temporall bleſſing beſtowed upon ſuch as were without the covenant. God is pleaſed to beſtow temporall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, with a full hand, upon ſuch as are Aliens from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael. We ſee this in manifold examples; how God hath made the cup of the wicked run over with theſe outward things: <hi>Eſau</hi> had the fatneſs of the earth, for his portion; and thoſe Sodomites that were ſo profligately wicked, yet dwelt in a place, that was as the garden of Eden: And the Canaanites whom God caſt out, and were ſo notorious for all kindes of abomination; had a land, that flowed with milke and honey. The rich glutton in the Goſpel, was <hi>cloathed in purple, and fared deliciouſly every day:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> and that other, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. had his barnes full, and looked to receive his incoms: They have had, and have, honour and great places, and offices: they have had children at their deſire; they have had goodly dwellings, and gotten great victories, and been ſuccesfull in many enterprizes: and there be many reaſons of this.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God will ſhew his bounty, even to the veſſels of wrath; there ſhall be none but ſhall partake of his favour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſome good may be found in the moſt deſperate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſome morall good; ſome action (though not in their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet) in the event, that hath ſome goodneſs in it; and the leaſt good, God will not ſuffer to go unrewarded: As Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, upon <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 29.<note place="margin">S Ierom.

            <p>Thirdly, God will hereby render them inexcuſable; if they be not allured by his favours, he will be juſtified in his judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſeemeth to add a fourth reaſon; drawn from the nature of theſe outward bleſſings. <hi>Dantur bonis, ne putentur mala; dantur malis, ne putentur ſumme bona:</hi> They are given to good men, leſt they ſhould be thought evill things; and they are given

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E told you, the words of the Angel to <hi>Hagar</hi> were of three ſorts:</p>
            <p>Firſt, words of Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of Admonition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, of Prediction.</p>
            <p>We have diſpatched the two firſt, and entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the third.</p>
            <p>The Prediction is of three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the multiplication of her ſeed, verſ. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the childe ſhe went withal, that was to be the root of that numerous iſſue, verſ. 8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Concerning the quality and condition of the childe, verſ. 12.</p>
            <p>The firſt Prediction we ſtood upon the laſt day: Now we are come to the ſecond; and this Prediction hath many Conſolations in it:</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning her conception.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that ſhe ſhall bring forth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the iſſue ſhall be a ſon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that his name ſhall be <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in the reaſon of his name much comfort, in that God had heard her affliction.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>Behold, thou art with childe: Lyra,</hi> and others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lyra,</hi> Gloſſa ordin.</note> read it in the future tenſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt conceive.</hi> And they have this conceit, that <hi>Hagar</hi> (firſt, in way of puniſhment for her ſin, for her inſolency toward her miſtreſs, and her flight from her; and ſecondly, through the wearineſs of her journey) had ſuffered abortion: her former conception was fruſtrated; but now God in his mercy (upon her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation) would revive that <hi>embryo,</hi> that was dead within her. But <hi>Paulus Burgenſis</hi> recites this as a Fable,<note place="margin">Paulus Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis.</note> and confutes the reaſon that <hi>Lyra</hi> giveth.

            <p>But now then, in the next place, ſhe was with childe already; and what comfort (will ſome ſay) in the Angels word unto her, <hi>Behold, thou art with childe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes; ſhe might judge that ſhe was with childe, and yet not be ſo: it is no ſtrange thing, that women ſhould be miſtaken in that kinde: Many have thought themſelves with childe, and reckoned from ſuch a time; yet it hath proved but a falſe conception: but now that the Angel of God aſſures her it is ſo, it muſt needs adde to her comfort.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I am ſure, this holdeth true in regard of the ſoul: there are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times good motions, and good deſires, which are the conceptions of the ſoul: but becauſe there is in every one (even the beſt) much corruption, and a kinde of ſpiritual guile, and a ſelf-love, whereby men are apt to think better of themſelves then there is cauſe; when a man that hath piety and underſtanding, and hath his ſenſes exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>diſcern both good and evil,</hi> as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. ſhall, by examination of things,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.14.</note> finde ſuch motions to be good, and the reſultances of Gods holy Spirit ſhall witneſs them ſo to be; it giveth great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the heart of another, yea even in thoſe things whereof the heart is well perſwaded, and in a manner aſſured; yet the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another addes much to the comfort. <hi>Daniel</hi> (no queſtion) was perſwaded of Gods love toward him; yet when the Angel tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him that he is <hi>greatly beloved,</hi>

And ſuch ſtrength is added to many, by the Angels of the Churches, which are the Miniſters: when a man find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe and theſe things in himſelf, and is perſwaded of the reality and truth of them; yet, when either in publike preaching, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conference, the man of God ſets to his ſeal, there is an increaſe comfort: Yea, even private Chriſtians may receive confirmation from

How many are the faintings, the longings, the nauſeating of this and that food?

Theſe things ſet out unto us, the difficulty and danger of bringing forth; and therefore it may be juſtly accounted a great bleſſing here promiſed; that ſhe ſhall not miſcarry, but bring forth.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of this is:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application Vnto wives.</note>Firſt, To women that are with childe, that ſeeing it is Gods bleſſiing, they ſhould direct their prayers unto him, for their happy progreſs in this great work: Not unto <hi>Lucina,</hi> as the Heathens; or as the Papiſts to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or any other Saint or Angell; but to God; whoſe ſole bleſſing 'tis both to conceive, and to bring forth. Secondly, they ſhould not be guilty of any thing, whereby they may prevent this bleſſing; ſuch intemperance is in ſome, ſuch hunting and violent agitations of their bodies, that they oftentimes miſcarry, and are the cauſes of much woe to themſelves; beſides the contemptuous repelling of Gods bleſſing, that they are guilty of. Thirdly, It ſhould teach them, after their childe-bearing, to give God thanks; and that not only in a perfunctory and formall manner, or in ſome concealed way, as if they were aſhamed of it: but to do it ſolemnly, and even to require the aſſiſtance of the congregation: for there are but few deliverances temporall, that hold weight with the delivery from the paines of child-birth; and certainly, if Gods mercy be in a fire, our thankfulneſs muſt not be in a froſt: if we ſhall be earneſt to cry to God in our wants, and not return to give thanks, a worſe Leproſie ſticketh to the ſouls of thoſe in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, then they under the Law were afraid of in their bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">To husbands.</note>Secondly, It is an Uſe to Husbands, that ſeeing this is ſuch a bleſſing, they ſhould do their part in praying unto God, in the behalfe of their wives; that they may have an happy paſſage, through ſuch great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and may ſafely bring that into the world, which they goe withal. Thirdly, they ſhould favour them all the time, both in contenting them, to their power, with ſuch meats as they have a minde to: 2. not putting upon them hard or difficult employments. 3. in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding things neceſſary againſt the time that they ſhall lie down; and at that time, being tender over them, and comfortable unto them. And certainly, were there not Religion to enjoyn this, Reaſon and equity would require it, That ſeeing the woman hath the pain and ſorrow, and the man free, (whoſe childe it was, as well as hers) he ſhould be reſpective of her, and loving unto her, and not be wanting in any thing neceſſary for her.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">To children.</note>Fourthly, it is an Uſe for Children. Is it ſuch a bleſſing of God,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41147:87"/> to bring them thorow ſuch difficulties and dangers into the world?</p>
            <p n="1">1. They ſhould be thankful to God.<note place="margin">To children.</note> How did he preſerve them ſo many moneths, in the dark receptacle of the womb! <hi>Nazianzen</hi> calleth men <gap reason="foreign">

God hath brought them forth alive, and therefore it is worthy of their beſt acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſhould quicken their love, and reſpect, and obedience to their mother: the mother bought this bleſſing dearly, and they owe the mother much. <hi>Matri debes longa faſtidia,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Ambroſe) longa diſcrimina;</hi> Thou oweſt to thy mother many longings, many loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, many tedious dangers: <hi>Tibi jejunavit, tibi comedit;</hi>

It is true, ſuch is the corruption of mans nature, that he that will reſpect the father, is not ſo reſpective of the mother: ſhe is the weaker veſſel, and men take a liberty to ſtep over the hedge where it is loweſt. But we ſhall finde father and mother joyned, in the Commandment: <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſaid to have obeyed his father and his mother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. and <hi>Solomon,</hi> at leaſt twenty times in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> mentioneth both father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And we ſhall finde, <hi>Levit.</hi> 29.<note place="margin">Gen. 28.7.</note> the mother put before the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>You ſhall fear every man his mother and his father:</hi> as if he would on purpoſe meet with that neglect that is of the mother.<note place="margin">Levit. 29.3.</note> But were there not this charge, yet the conſideration of the many pains and pangs that the mother hath endured, the many watchings and much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſhe hath had for the childes good, would obliege every one that hath the leaſt ſpark of good nature, to a due love and reſpect unto her. Upon this ground, old <hi>Toby</hi> counſelleth his ſon, to love and reverence his mother, and <hi>not to be wanting unto her all his days.</hi> Oh then, having been brought into the light thorow ſo much trouble to the mother, let every childe love her, honour her, never ſuffer her to want.

Or laſtly, whether it be becauſe the male doth longeſt continue the name of the family: for it dieth in the female, being planted into another ſtock; I do not determine. But, commonly, the affection of the mother is to the male: and therefore <hi>Sarah</hi> is told, ſhe ſhall <hi>have a ſon;</hi> and the mother of <hi>Samſon</hi> is told, ſhe ſhall <hi>have a ſon: Hannah,</hi> being barren, one would have thought, ſhould have been contented,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.11.</note> even with a female; yet you ſhall ſee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. that her deſire is for a man-childe.

            <p>For the Uſe of it:</p>
            <p>A ſon is Gods bleſſing,<note place="margin">Application</note> and it is not ſimply unlawfull to ask it of God; but it muſt be with ſubmiſſion of our deſires and requeſts to Gods good will and pleaſure: and if it ſhall pleaſe God not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer us in the thing we deſire, yet not to be tumultuous, or murmure at it: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Beggers muſt be no chuſers: it were an inſolent part in a begger, becauſe he could not have what he would, to deſpiſe that which is given. <hi>Omnes mendici Dei ſumus,</hi> (ſaith the Father;) we are all beggers to the Almighty; and he will give us what he thinks good, and we are bound to take it thankfully.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt know, that he doth more for us, in giving us any children at all, then he oweth us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if people had no childe, they would be glad of any.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it may be, though God doth not hear us <hi>ad voluntatem,</hi> (ſaith the Father) yet <hi>ad ſalutem;</hi> according to our will, yet he doth, to our welfare. In denying us that which our hearts much ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, he preventeth our ſin (as foreſeeing we would too much doat upon it) and our ſorrow: if he ſhould take it away, we ſhould be more afflicted: and croſſes ſooneſt come in thoſe things we love moſt. Or if that childe ſhould miſcarry, by a lewd courſe, it would be ſo much more vexation, by how much our affection hath been greater; as we ſee in <hi>Abſalon,</hi> whoſe ruine was the more grievous to <hi>David,</hi> becauſe he paſſionately loved and affected him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let it teach us, that when God ſatisfieth our deſire, in the particular thing we deſire, whether it be male or female, to be truely thankful for it, and to make right uſe of it. We have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to expect, that God ſhould gratifie us in the very individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing that we deſire: for, how often, when he calleth for this and that at our hands, do we put him off, and ſend him away empty? And if we do any thing, it is no further then it ſtandeth with our own liking; ſo that we rather pleaſe our ſelves then God. And therefore when (notwithſtanding the ill meaſure we offer him) he ſhall give us our deſires in the very thing we ask, we have reaſon to be thankful, and put ſuch a bleſſing to the beſt uſe, even that which may make moſt for Gods glory: ſo did <hi>Hannah,</hi> as appeareth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. the two laſt verſes.</note> 
               <hi>For this childe I prayed, and the Lord hath given me my portion which I asked of him: therefore alſo have I lent him unto the Lord; as long as he liveth, he ſhall be lent unto the Lord.</hi> So ſay every of you, when you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this or that childe, and can ſay, This is the ſon of my deſires, this is the daughter of my prayers; I begged earneſtly for him or her, and God heard my requeſt: be more careful to bring them up in the fear of God; and provide that they may honour God in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41147:89"/> And let not a fond and carnal affection and indulgence, make you forget the bleſſing you have received; God hath fulfilled your deſires, ſeek to fulfill his, which is to be moſt honoured with thoſe bleſſings, that he hath beſtowed upon your importunity; if you fail in this, there may a curſe lye in that which you have moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired, and obtained; and you may ſmart to purpoſe, for your unthankfulneſs.</p>
            <p>The fourth conſolation in this prediction is in the name, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the name:<note place="margin">The repetition of that paſſage.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name Iſhmael.</hi> This was not to give power to her to impoſe the name, for it properly belonged unto the husband: and ſo we ſhall finde afterward, that <hi>Abraham</hi> called his ſons name (which <hi>Hagar</hi> bare,) <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> And ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> altered the name that his wife had given, from <hi>Benoni</hi> to <hi>Benjamin:</hi> if we finde in Scripture,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>4.</hi> The impoſition of the name belongs unto the Father; yet no name, or other externals whatſoever, to be boaſted of, or deemed a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. <hi>Ruth. 4. 1 Sam. 1.</hi>
               </note> that women gave names to their children, we muſt ſuppoſe the conſent of their husbands; not that they did it by their own authority. The wife of <hi>Manoah</hi> bare a ſon, and called his name <hi>Sampſon;</hi> the women, the neighbours of <hi>Naomi,</hi> gave the childe a name, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4. but we muſt ſuppoſe, it was ſuggeſted unto <hi>Boaz,</hi> and he appointed it. So <hi>Hannah</hi> gave <hi>Samuel</hi> his name, no doubt with the conſent of her husband <hi>Elkanah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> likewiſe, when the child was to be circumciſed, and the neighbours would have him called <hi>Zacharias,</hi> after his father; ſhe ſaid no, he muſt be called <hi>John;</hi> yet was not that ratified, till the father himſelf was conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and when he ſaid it muſt be ſo, they called him <hi>Iohn:</hi> but I let that paſs;<note place="margin">Cajetan in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> he ſhall be called <hi>Iſhmael, nec praeterea,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cajetan,</hi> take knowledg that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> is the firſt, in Scripture, that God gave a name unto, before he was born: but withall another obſerveth, that he was the only ill in Scripture, whoſe name is foretold: The next was <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ioſias,</hi> in the old teſtament; and the Baptiſt and our bleſſed Saviour, in the new: But in or before the birth of theſe four (whoſe names were foretold,) there was ſome miracle ſhewed; <hi>Iſaac</hi> born of <hi>Sarah</hi> at ninety years of age: when <hi>Joſias</hi> was named, the Altar clove in ſunder,<note place="margin">1 Kings 13.2.</note> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. When the Baptiſt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, his Father was ſtrucken dumb; and Chriſt was born of a virgin: but in the foretelling of <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> name, no miracle, that we read of, was wrought; unleſs we will give way unto the fiction of the Hebrews, (that we mentioned in the beginning;) that the childe was dead in <hi>Hagars</hi> womb, upon her long travell; and miraculouſly revived again. Well then, the foretelling of <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> name, though (as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerveth;<note place="margin">S.

There is a conceit, that poſſeſſeth the minde of many a

It hath not been only uſed, to diſtinguiſh one party from another; but 2. in the ſecond place, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſomething to come. So <hi>Hevah</hi> had her name, becauſe ſhe was to be the mother of all living: and <hi>Abram</hi> was called <hi>Abraham,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was to be the Father of much people; and <hi>Sarah,</hi> becauſe ſhe was to be the mother of Princes. And <hi>Iſaac</hi> had his name from laughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only becauſe of the preſent rejoycing of his parents, but becauſe he was to be cauſe of joy to poſterity, in regard the Meſſiah was to ſpring from him: And <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> becauſe God would add another ſon. And <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe he was to be a peaceful Prince. And <hi>Ieſus, becauſe he was to ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> 3. Names have been impoſed, to keep in freſh memory, ſome bleſſing paſt; and ſo we ſee <hi>Iacob</hi> hath the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to put him ſtill in minde of his wreſtling with God, and how he prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with him. So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> called his elder Son <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> becauſe God had made him forget his affliction; and his younger, <hi>Ephraim,</hi> becauſe God had made him fruitful in the land of his affliction. And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> had his name, from being drawn out of the flaggs. And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> becauſe he was begged of God; yea to this purpoſe, that Gods people might remember his mercies, they have given names to places: <hi>Abraham</hi> calls the place where God had ſpared <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22. c. 28.</note> and provided another ſacrifice in his room, <hi>Iehovah-jireh; the Lord will provide,</hi> that he might never forget the experiment he had, of Gods gratious providence: <hi>Jacob</hi> changeth the name of <hi>Luz,</hi> into <hi>Bethel, the houſe of God, Gen.</hi> 28. that he might ever remember how gratiouſly and comfortably God had revealed himſelf unto him, in that place: <hi>Iehoſophat,</hi> and the people, that they might never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the marvellous comfort that they had received from God, in a ſtrange deliverance, from an invincible army of the Ammonites
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41147:90"/> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> called the place (where they met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to praiſe God for his mercy) the valley of <hi>Berakah (i. e.)</hi> the valley of bleſſing,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.</note> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. yea, they have given names to times: <hi>Mordecai</hi> and Gods people, to keep in perpetual remembrance that deliverance of theirs from that conſpiracy of <hi>Haman,</hi> did not only keep thoſe daies wherein execution ſhould have paſſed upon them, as daies of rejoycing, every yeare; but called them daies of <hi>Purim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eſther</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Eſther 9.</note>

            <p>Laſtly, Names have been given unto men, as to mind them of Gods mercy to them, ſo of their duty to him; that as oft as they heare or remember their name, they might be ſtirred up to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obedience: as <hi>Judah,</hi> that is from praiſing; <hi>Simeon,</hi> from hearing; and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the ſon of his fathers right hand; which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his duty in it.

            <p>Now for the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Firſt, Let all Parents learn to give fitting Names to their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, ſuch as may mind them of Gods mercy, and their duty; ſuch as may be Monitors to them upon all occaſions, to remember God and themſelves: Scripture Names are fit to be given, for they have good inſtructions in them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Names of vertuous Predeceſſours, by whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they may be ſtirred up to tread in their ſteps. They too too much offend, that care not what heatheniſh Names they give to their Children; and ſome give ſuch ridiculous Names, that they are far from Chriſtianity, or Civility: And ſome again are ſo affected, and rather give Sentences, ſometimes, then Names; that (me thinks) it is a diſhonor to God, in whoſe Name the Child is baptized; to the holy Sacrament which is ſolemnized; and to the Congregation of Saints, before whom the Name is given; yea, to the Child it ſelf, who is like to carry a mock and a brand, rather than a Name, all the daies of the life of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When people have good and ſignificant Names given unto them, let them labour to make them good; ſo did <hi>John:</hi> He had the grace of God; and <hi>Theophilus,</hi> He loved God. So did <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus,</hi> according to his name, He was a man that feared God.

And ſo the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have a glorious name, but (as one ſaith of the Philoſophers) <hi>Nomen ſibi ſolum retinuerunt,</hi> They have retained only the name unto themſelves; for how unlike are they to him whoſe name they do moſt impudently uſurp?

            <p>We have diſpatched the words of Queſtion and Direction; and in thoſe of Prediction, are come as far as his Name:<note place="margin">Calvin in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.

It is certain, that God is ſo merciful, that many times he bringeth thoſe out of trouble, that never ſeek unto him in their trouble: and ſome negligent ones are apt to plead this; and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41147:92"/> therefore when the hand of God is upon them, they do not make ſupplications to their Judg; but ſuch ſhould know, that that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which cometh without ſeeking,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Application</hi> Dan. 9.23.</note> hath not that comfort and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in it, which that hath that commeth upon a mans paines: for it argueth the love of God to a man, as the Angel telleth <hi>Dan. c.</hi> 9. <hi>At the beginning of thy Supplications the Commandement came forth, and I am come to ſhew thee, for thou art greatly beloved.</hi> Secondly, it ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up love in men towards God. <hi>I love the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 116.<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.1.</note>) <hi>becauſe he hath heard my voice and my ſupplications.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. two laſt verſes.</note> It ſtirreth one up to the greater thankfulneſs, as we ſee in <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. the two laſt verſes, <hi>For this Child I prayed, and the Lord hath given me my Petition which I asked of him, therefore have I alſo lent him unto the Lord; and as long as he liveth he ſhall be lent unto the Lord:</hi> That eſtate which is caſt upon a man unexpectedly, hath not that true ſweetneſs in it, with that which a man hath gotten by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry: And therefore it is promiſed as a ſpeciall bleſſing, <hi>that a man ſhall eat the labour of his hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 128.2.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128. And ſo for a man to be freed from trouble, without any ſeeking unto God, is not ſo comfortable, as when a man hath prayed and begged hard for it.</p>
            <p>But I hold you no longer in this:</p>
            <p>For with the leave of ſo Reverend an Author as <hi>Calvin</hi> is, it may very well be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Hagar</hi> did pray, in her affliction, unto the Lord; and that God upon her humble prayer was inclined to ſhew her mercy: and therefore the moſt underſtand by this Phraſe; <hi>He hath heard thine affliction,</hi> the prayers which ſhe made in her Affliction; and ſo the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe Tranſlateth it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chald.</hi> Paraph.</note> 
               <hi>Hath received thy prayers.</hi> And what a ground of joy is this, to have a mans Prayer admitted, and acceptable?<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>2.</hi> The great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, with Caution touching apprehenſions of the contrary <hi>Iob 30.20.

               </note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) that hath not turned away my Prayer, Pſal.</hi> 66.10. And he is often rejoycing, becauſe the Lord had heard him. On the other ſide, how grievous is it, for a mans Prayers to find none admittance, as we hear <hi>Job</hi> complaining, <hi>Cha.</hi> 30. <hi>I cry unto thee, but thou doſt not hear me;</hi> I <hi>ſtand up, and thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeſt me not.

So the Church, <hi>Lamentations</hi> 3.8. <hi>When</hi> I <hi>cry and ſhout, he ſhutteth out my prayer.</hi> So how God threatneth his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. <hi>When you ſpread out your hands,</hi> I <hi>will hide mine eyes from you, yea, when you make many prayers,</hi> I <hi>will not hear.</hi> Sometimes God not only not admitteth, but he rejecteth the Petitions of ſome, that their prayer becomes ſin,<note place="margin">Pſal. 109.7.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.7. Yea, their prayer is an abomination, <hi>Prov,</hi> 28.9. So there is a comfort, to have Prayer thought well of; and ſo is it for any other duty that we perform to God; a great comfort to <hi>Abel</hi> it was,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.4.</note> that God did accept his Sacrifice.

               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.7. God ſaith, <hi>he will make his people joyfull in the houſe of prayer, (i.e.)</hi> whoſoever therin ſhould devoutly appear, their burnt Offerings and their Sacrifices ſhould be accepted: what a comfort was it to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, Act</hi> 10.4. when the Angel told him,<note place="margin">Act. 10.4.</note> that <hi>his Prayers and Almes were come up for a memorial before God:</hi> God did not only take knowledg of them, and like well of them, but they were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as a ſtanding pillar in Gods ſight: Well might <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccle. 9.7.</note> 
               <hi>and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for now God accepteth thy works.</hi> It is not to ſay, with what a delicious raviſhing ſweetneſs the ſoul is filled, when it is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Gods acceptation of its ſervices.</p>
            <p>Again, Gods hearing of Prayer is not only an admittance and accepting of it, but a reſolution and purpoſe of ſatisfying the deſires of his people, ſo far as may ſtand with his glory, to give; and their good, to receive: When he is deſcribed to be a God that heareth Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. It is not only meant,<note place="margin">Pſal. 65.2.</note> that he lendeth an eare to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but he condeſcendeth to a ſatisfaction of thoſe Prayers: He fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the deſire of thoſe that fear him; <hi>he heareth their cry, and ſaveth them, Pſal.</hi> 145.<note place="margin">Pſa. 145.19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore for the Uſe of it:</p>
            <p>How may this encourage us to pour out our wants before God,<note place="margin">Application</note> in the time of our Affliction? This is that courſe that Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have taken, in any kind of diſtreſs; if it have been diſtreſs out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, either in regard of enemies, we ſhall find <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> ſeeking the Lord, when that great Army came againſt him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. If ſickneſs, <hi>Hezekiah turneth him to the wall, and prayeth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 16.20.</note> If ſcorn and contempt, <hi>Job</hi> 16. <hi>My friends ſcorn me, but mine eyes poure out teares unto God.</hi> Teares the ſtrongeſt Oratory; And that which offereth the greateſt violence to Heaven.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In any inward deſires they have uſed this means; as when they have been troubled with ſome ſtrong temptation: when the meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.8.</note> He ran to God by Prayer, <hi>For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me:</hi> Or if their conſcience have been wracked with a ſence of Gods wrath, They have betaken themſelves to Prayer. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.5. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſorrows of hell compaſſed me about,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 18.5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>the ſnares of death prevented me; in my diſtreſs</hi> I <hi>called upon the Lord, and cryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my God.</hi> Yea, our bleſſed Lord, who was in a greater anguiſh of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then ever any man in the world was, (through the apprehenſion of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41147:93"/> Gods fierce wrath againſt him,) ſought comfort this way; <hi>he offered up prayers and ſupplications,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> 
               <hi>with ſtrong crying and teares, Heb.</hi> 5.7. Let us then take the courſe that Gods people have done; and upon this <hi>receipt,</hi> there is a <hi>probatum</hi> in all times: faithfull prayer, hath ever been as <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, that hath brought an Olive-Leafe of peace at laſt: and if we have not, ſo ſoon as we deſire, a return of our prayers, (for ſome Reaſons beſt known to God;) this may ſupport us:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that God takes knowledg of our prayers; he could tell <hi>Ananias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 9.11.</note> that <hi>Paul prayed, Acts.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 141.2.</note>Secondly, they are pleaſing unto him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. as <hi>Incenſe,</hi> as <hi>odours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, he will certainly give an anſwer in due ſeaſon, for he hath bound himſelf by promiſe.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 15.2.</note> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. <hi>If we ſeek him, he will be found of us; the ſeed of Iacob ſhall not ſeek him in vain, Iſaiah.</hi> 45.19. <hi>and this is our confidence, that we have in him.</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>that if we aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us:</hi> in the mean time, it is our duty to wait, to tarry the Lords leiſure.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">An exception. Obſerv. <hi>3.</hi> God oft delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth gratiouſly even thoſe that ſuffer deſervedly</note>Fourthly, He hearing, certainly He will ſtabliſh our hearts. But now there is an Objection againſt this; ſeeing God hears the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Hagar.</hi> Why, ſhe ſuffered juſtly, for her inſolency againſt her miſtreſs, and for her diſcontented flight; and therefore it was fit, ſhe ſhould ſmart for it; had ſhe been innocent, and had carried her ſelf fittingly; reaſon ſhe ſhould have been reſpected: for Gods care is for the innocent; <hi>David</hi> none other way expecteth a bleſſing from God, for <hi>Shimeis</hi> curſing of him; but becauſe he was innocent of the crimes objected againſt him,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.20. he ſaith, <hi>The Lord did recompence</hi> him, <hi>according to the cleanneſs of</hi> his <hi>hands.</hi> I Anſwer with <hi>Muſculus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Muſculus.</note> God delivereth gratiouſly, even thoſe that ſuffer deſervedly; and herein his mercy appeareth: for were there no cauſe of ſuffering, but that men were innocent, mercy had no place: If the beſt of us all, ſhould have no further hope of being delivered out of our afflictions, then we are innocent, we might juſtly deſpair of deliverance: for what meer man in the world, ever ſuffered, and did not deſerve it? It is true, it may be in regard of ſome thing objected, for which they ſuffer, they may be faultleſs, and men may be unjuſt in proſecuting them; but conſidering the affliction as comming from God, there is cauſe enough; and every man muſt <hi>lay his hand upon his mouth,</hi> and <hi>juſtifie God in his ſayings,</hi> and clear him <hi>when he is judged.</hi> Though <hi>David</hi> knew he was guiltleſs of any evill, done to the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> as <hi>Shimei</hi> charged him; yet he underſtood well, that he was faulty otherwiſe; and that God did puniſh his other ſins, by this ſcorn of a malignant tongue: If he ſpeak of Gods recompencing him, according to his innocency; he doth not quit himſelf from all fault; but only take knowledg of Gods favour, in reſpecting his innocency, in regard of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular objected. <hi>Iob</hi> ſuffered unjuſtly from his friends; and his heart
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41147:93"/> juſtified him, in that which they laid upon him: but yet he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth his own ill deſervings, and that God juſtly doth afflict him.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>Firſt, let it teach us to magnifie Gods goodneſs,<note place="margin">Application</note> and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men; who though they have juſtly incurred his wrath, and in regard of their provocations, he might be deaf to their prayers, and not deliver them; <hi>yet in the midſt of wrath, he remembreth mercy;</hi> and taketh matter of being merciful, from himſelf; heareth their prayers, and brings them out of trouble; <hi>he is a father of mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> 
               <hi>and a God of all conſolation: tam pius nemo, am pater nemo,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) none ſo fatherly, none ſo compaſſionate: <hi>He knoweth whereof</hi> men <hi>are made, and remembreth that</hi> they <hi>are but duſt; he dealeth not with</hi> them <hi>after their ſins, nor rewardeth</hi> them <hi>after</hi> their <hi>iniquities:</hi> though he might whip them with <hi>ſcorpions,</hi> he will do it only with <hi>rods,</hi> and thoſe rods he will remove too: <hi>the rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt upon the lot of the righteous.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 125.3.</note> 
               <hi>He will take them</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as the Greek Father calls it,) <hi>out of the furnace of affliction. He will not ſuffer them to be tempted,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, not to be ſwallowed up: He may ſuffer them <hi>premi, ſed non opprimi;</hi> to be preſſed, but yet not oppreſſed: it is true, there is deſert enough, for the continuance of his wrath; but yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>virga corrigente, non gladio conſumente;</hi> with a rod of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not with a ſword of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let this be another encouragement to us, to pray; ſome men apprehend ſo deeply the extent of their ſufferings, and are ſo conſcious to themſelves, of their irritating of God, that they are diſcouraged from ſuing unto God; <hi>mine iniquities have taken ſuch hold upon me, that I am not able to look up, Pſal.</hi> 40.<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.12.</note> And I wiſh that men could think of this, in the time of temptation to ſin; how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, how reſtleſs, how indiſpoſed their ſins will make them to prayer, in the time of their need: But yet this muſt not be given way to; for God ſheweth mercy, even to ſuch as he doth afflict juſtly: when <hi>David</hi> had uttered theſe words; <hi>my ſins are more then the haires of mine head, therefore my ſoul faileth me, Pſal.</hi> 40.12.<note place="margin">v. 13.</note> Yet for all that, Verſ. 13.

So <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſee and confeſs the juſtice of God; yet they beg Gods mercy. 2.

It is true, our ſins have deſerved all this, and worſe; yea the very dreggs of the viall: and we muſt ſay with <hi>Mauritius, juſtus es O Domine, &amp; recta judicia tua: juſt art thou O Lord, and righteous are thy judgments;</hi> but becauſe we are ſo deep, in the procuring of the ſtorm, ſhall we forbear to pray for the removing of it? O no; let us cry earneſtly, and mightily unto God, yea not to give over, though things ſhould grow to a greater extremity: <hi>cum duplicantur lateres, venit Moſes;</hi> when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> taskes were doubled, then came the deliverer; and mans extreamity, is Gods opportunity. Let us pray and pray ſtill, and joyn with our prayers, a godly, ſober, righteous, and peacefull life; and God is where he was, and the ſame he was; he will not take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, in that our ſins have drawn this upon us: <hi>but he will be found of us, and will heal our breaches, and return our peace and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon us, like a ſwelling floud.</hi>

            <p>The Reaſon whereof is eaſily given: Grace is not traduced from the Parent to the Child; the Father cannot conveigh holineſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, it is the gift of God; Let him be a ſanctified man, yet he begetteth a child as a man, not as an holy man, by naturall Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not ſpirituall Regeneration, <hi>Non ex principiis novitatis, ſed ex Reliquiis vetuſtatis,</hi> (ſaith the Father;) Not out of the principles of the new, but out of the Reliques of the old man:<note place="margin">Gen. 5.3.</note> 
               <hi>Adam</hi> begot <hi>Seth</hi> in his own image; and <hi>David</hi> acknowledges (though he had reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Parents) that <hi>he was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did</hi> his <hi>mother conceive him, Pſa.</hi> 51.<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note> The Corn purged from the chaff cometh up with it again, when it is ſowen: The Circumciſed father begetteth an uncircumciſed child: And ſo the Serpent without a ſting begetteth a Serpent with a ſting: So a godly perſon, though he can perhaps tranſmith is goods unto his Son, can he leave him his goodneſs? Can he conveigh his Graces, as his Lands? No, one mans goodneſs doth not moralize another.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Application</note> It muſt teach Parents to do what they can that their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren may be gracious; They muſt inſtruct them: They muſt inlay them with Piety in their tender years: They muſt follow them with good Advice: They muſt ſet them a good example, and they muſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41147:95"/> pray for them; they muſt correct them when occaſion is, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind the bundle of Folly that is in them; that ſo their Sons may grow up as the young Plants, and their Daughters may be as the Poliſhed corners of the Temple: If there be a defect on their part in this, and that the Children grow wild through want of their culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating and care, they have much to anſwer for.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, If notwithſtanding their care, the Children ſhall grow bad, they muſt reſt contented, they have freed their own ſouls, and the Childrens bloud ſhall be upon their own heads: They may plant and water, but it is God that muſt give the encreaſe; Grace is the gift of the Father of Spirits, and not of the Father of the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It ſhould teach Children to labour for a goodneſs of their own, for their Parents holineſs ſhall not make them holy, nor their Faith juſtifie them: Some have a conceit that it is goodneſs enough for them that their Parents were good; The <hi>Jews</hi> boaſted that they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> but St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt taketh them off from this, and biddeth them <hi>bring forth fruits worthy of life:</hi> And when our Lord perceived the ſame humour in them, He denieth them to be of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>They are of their father the devill,</hi>

And <hi>Valeſus</hi> (the Proconſul in <hi>Aſia</hi> under <hi>Auguſtus</hi>) having cauſed three hundred men to be ſlain, walked among the dead bodies, and ſaid, <hi>O rem regiam!</hi> A ſtately act in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed!

Yea, I might ſpeak of ſuch, as out of their deſire to give their bloudy minds contentment, and their wrathfull hearts ſatisfaction, have done what injuries malice could invent, to encreaſe the torments of others, to make them dye

               <hi>their very bowels are cruel,</hi> and what then are their cruelties? But it may be you are tyred with this ſad narration; if you be not, I am: and therefore I will turn my ſelf, to matter of exhortation.</p>
            <p>And for the application of this point;<note place="margin">Application</note> be we all exhorted to take heed of bloody mindedneſs, it is a thing unbeſeeming us as men: God ſendeth man into the world as harmleſs a creature, and as unapt to offer any injury, as any creature whatſoever; and ſure he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in it, that <hi>Homo,</hi> ſhould be <hi>homini Deus, non Lupus:</hi> that one man ſhould be a God (as it were) unto another,, and not a wolfe. He never meant, that a man ſhould be afraid to fall into the hands of men; (as <hi>David</hi> was, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.) But that one man,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.14.</note> ſhould be an <hi>Aſylum</hi> and a Sanctuary unto another; he did intend him to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſociable creature; and that men ſhould live together, in a loving fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>And therefore, in the Second place, to be cruel and bloody, is a ſin even againſt humane ſociety; nay even the beaſts themſelves, that be of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> do not offer violence to one another: and what a fearfull thing is it, to ſee men embrue their hands in each others blood, Chriſtians! Countrymen! Neighbours! Brethren!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is againſt Gods expreſs commandement: how ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he charge men, againſt blood and cruelty: and under what a penalty? Now how doth he forbid cruelty,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.19.</note> even towards the brute creatures? <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſeeth the kid in the mothers milke:</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the damm, with the young ones:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 22.6.</note> 
               <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.28. <hi>The old and the young, muſt not be killed both in one day.</hi> Thoſe precepts were <hi>ſepimentum legis,</hi> the hedge of the law: And the reaſon was, <hi>commendare clementiam</hi> (ſaith one,) to recommend clemency and gentleneſs to men: <hi>Et ut mitiores eſſent erga homines</hi> (ſaith another,) that they might be the more tender-hearted, to each other; for certainly, they that are cruel towards beaſts, are in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to be cruel to men: And therefore the <hi>Athenians</hi> wiſely puniſhed thoſe boys, whoſe practice was to catch crows, and to put out the eyes of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If it be againſt the Law, to be cruel; I am ſure it is againſt the Goſpel, which is the Goſpel of peace; which breaths nothing, nor commands any thing, but that which tends to peace and mercy, and love, and compaſſion: and nothing ſo contrary to chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, as cruelty:<note place="margin">Iſai. 2.4.</note> It was propheſied of the Church of the new teſtament, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.4. That they ſhould <hi>break their ſwords into plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their ſpeares into pruning hooks;</hi> and that <hi>nation ſhould not lift
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41147:98"/> up the ſword againſt nation:</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 11.</note> and again, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11. <hi>That the wolfe ſhould dwell with the Lambe, and the Leopard with the Kid; the calfe, and the young Lyon, and a little childe ſhall leade them:</hi> that is, they that were of a fierce and ſavage diſpoſition, ſhould be compoſed to meekneſs and love; but alas, if <hi>Nazianzen</hi> could put himſelf into a paſſion at any time, by reading the lamentations of <hi>Jeremy:</hi> whoſe heart will not bleed, to think of the warrs amongſt Chriſtians? who like the <hi>Midianites,</hi> have thruſt their ſwords into each others ſides; and dance, in one anothers aſhes: What horrour is there in reading the late outrages in <hi>Germany!</hi> thoſe now freſh bleeding wounds of <hi>Ireland!</hi> where as cruel acts are done, as any former ſtory can paralell: and by brethren, by Chriſtians againſt Chriſtians! how have people buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all ſenſe of Chriſtianity: the very beaſts of different kinds, while they were in <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, did agree together, and thoſe that are within the fellowſhip of the ſame Chriſtian Church, are bloody towards each other: how have we taken off, a great part of the reproach of the Pagans of the world? and ſtrengthned their hand to impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; while we that profeſs the Prince of peace, and doctrine of peace, are at ſuch deadly differences amongſt our ſelves: In the fear of God, let us take heed of cruelty: and firſt let us avoid ſome ſpecial ſins, that are apt to lead us on to this.</p>
            <p>As Firſt, ambition, and a deſire of advancement; what made <hi>Zimri</hi> kill his maſter, but ambition; or <hi>Abſolon</hi> ſupplant his Father, but ambition; or <hi>Herod,</hi> to kill the infants, (to take away the King of the <hi>Iewes,)</hi> but ambition; and the maintenance of his uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take heed of covetouſneſs; thoſe in the proverbs, are ſaid to <hi>wait for blood,</hi> that they might fill their <hi>houſes with ſpoiles: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucuk</hi> telleth of ſuch as <hi>aedificabant in ſanguine,</hi> that did build in blood; That is, ſuch as by violence and oppreſsion, force in their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and cut their way to poſſeſſion: As <hi>Ahab</hi> hunted <hi>Naboths</hi> blood, that he might have his vineyard: And thoſe in the Goſpel would <hi>kill the heire,</hi> that the <hi>inheritance might be</hi> theirs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let us take heed of envy, it was that which made <hi>Cain</hi> kill his brother; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are not much diſtant from each other, malice and miſchief. <hi>Sauls</hi> envy ſeeketh the blood of <hi>David:</hi> and the Phariſees and others, did ſo envy the reputation that Chriſt had in the world, that they gave not over, till they had his life.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Let us take heed of luſt, it was that which put on <hi>David</hi> to the murder of <hi>Vriah:</hi> Some proſtitutes have had ſuch power over their luſtful lovers, that they have put them on to the ſhedding of blood: The luſt of <hi>Herodias</hi> was the cauſe of the loſs of Saint Iohn <hi>Baptiſts</hi> head.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Let us beware of exceſs; <hi>who hath contention, who hath wounds without cauſe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23.29.</note> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 23. <hi>but he that ſitteth long at the wine;</hi> when wine hath inflamed the blood, and unthroned
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41147:98"/> Reaſon, then a little occaſion moveth a quarrel, and the hand is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſword. <hi>Alexander</hi> killed his <hi>Clytus,</hi> in his drunkenneſs; and examples are too numerous; (even in theſe times) of thoſe that have ſlain others in their wine.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, take we heed of nouriſhing Anger and Diſpleaſure long: for if we do, the Apoſtle tells us, we <hi>give place to the devil;</hi> and we know, <hi>he is a murderer,</hi> and will put on to blood. Anger retained, groweth as ſowre as Malice; and Malice hath black and bloody reſolutions: as we ſee in <hi>Abſalon</hi> againſt <hi>Amnon;</hi> who kept his wrath ſo long, until it burſt out into blood.</p>
            <p>I would, in the laſt place, adviſe to take heed of an erroneous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or a Zeal without true Knowledge: for even this hath put on many to blood; it hath made ſome ſacrifice their own children; as we ſee in the Old Teſtament. Thoſe thought they did God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, while they killed his ſervants, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16.2. Acts 26.</note> in his blinde way, (as himſelf confeſſeth, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.) <hi>thought he ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> And certainly, that Apoſtle, reprehending himſelf for the cruelty which he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the poor Saints, willeth us to beware of the ſame.</p>
            <p>And in the ſecond place, there is ſomething to be done, to keep us from Cruelty; and that is, to get into our hearts a conſcience of Gods Commandments: Amongſt thoſe Laws that were given with ſuch terrour, this is one, againſt blood: And if the Lion hath roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let us be afraid.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let us think how like we are to God by mercy, who is the preſerver both of man and beaſt:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſolvo, deſtruo.</note> And how like by cruelty to Sathan, who is <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and <hi>Apolyon, (i. e.)</hi> both in his Hebrew and Greek name, a Deſtroyer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Think we of that <hi>exemplum indeficiens,</hi> that exquiſite Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of our bleſſed Lord, who in all his time never did hurt to the body of any man; though <hi>Moſes</hi> plagued <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> called for fire from Heaven, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> for the Bears, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſmote <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Paul Elymas</hi> with blindneſs, yet he never hurt any; when they fell backwards that came to apprehend him, he ſuffered them to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and healed the eare of one of them: He <hi>came not to deſtroy, but to ſave,</hi> as he telleth his Diſciples, who would have had him given way unto them to <hi>call for fire from heaven</hi> upon thoſe in hoſpitable <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans;</hi> and ſhould we not learn of him to be humble and meek? Should not the ſame mind be in us that was in Chriſt Jeſus?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, think we how cruelty ſtaines the ſoul, it maketh it of a Scarlet, of a Crimſon dye, that many tears will not cleanſe it; yea, it woundeth the ſoul in that manner, that much Prayer and Faſting will not be enough to heal it: When <hi>David</hi> hath this to anſwer for, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out, <hi>Amplius me lava Domine; Waſh me throughly O Lord,</hi> more and more; and he prayeth again, <hi>Deliver me from bloud-guiltineſs, O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Often think of the Judgement to come, at what time the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41147:99"/> meek in ſpirit ſhall be much ſet by, and the mercifull ſhall find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but a Judgment mercileſs to ſuch as have been cruell.</p>
            <p>And now in the cloſe of this Exhortation, Let us know that it is directed to us all; neither is it needleſs to thoſe that are very forward in Religion; for as they have naturally the ſeed of all ſin in them, ſo they are apt upon Temptation even to be cruell: It was <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levy,</hi> whoſe anger their Father curſed becauſe it was fierce, and their wrath becauſe it was cruell,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.7.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. And how was <hi>David</hi> hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into a cruell way? And ſo <hi>Jonah</hi> could have been content that all <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhould have been deſtroyed; nay, took it ill it was not ſo. And <hi>Theodoſius</hi> an excellent Prince, and no vertue in him ſo eminent as compaſſion, <hi>Beneficium ſe accepiſſe putabat, cum regaretur ignoſcere:</hi> That he thought he had received a favour of any one, that deſired him to forgive; And yet upon an occaſion of an uproare at <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> wherein one of his Servants was ſlain, he commanded an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Maſſacre to paſs upon the City without diſtinction, ſo that in a ſhort time there were ſeven thouſand butchered; which coſt him deare before he could wipe it out, as they know that have read Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his dealing with him. Even the Godly are ſubject to fierce and intemperate affections; and had therefore need to keep the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger watch over themſelves, leſt they do that in their haſte, which they muſt repent at leaſure.</p>
            <p>And ſo I leave the Point, with craving of pardon for my length in it, which the badneſs of theſe laſt times hath driven me to, which are times of blood and cruelty, of rage and fury; and but a few there are, that tread the ways of love, peace, and ſobriety.</p>
            <p>There is another thing to be obſerved, in that <hi>his hand is againſt every man:</hi> he giveth the quarrel. And this is the nature of wicked and fierce men, that they are ſo reſtleſs, that they will provoke; not ſtay till they be provoked.<note place="margin">Pſal. 35.20.</note> Such <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. <hi>They ſpeak not peace, but deviſe deceitful words againſt them that are quiet in the land.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>3.</hi> Impious ſpirits are always apt unto Contention; as truely religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearts to Peace.</note> Such were thoſe enemies of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that <hi>did deviſe devices againſt him, and ſmote him with the tongue,</hi> Jer. 18.18. when he gave them no cauſe: and thoſe again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.10. that did <hi>watch for his halting:</hi> yea, ſought to entice him, that ſo they might take revenge upon him. And ſo it is ſaid of ſome that provoked our Saviour to ſpeak of many things, willing to pick a quarrel. Such an one was <hi>Alexander;</hi> of whom it was ſaid, that he would fight with ſtones and mountains, if he had not men to fight withal. And ſo of one <hi>Coelius,</hi> who was of ſo turbulent a ſpirit, that he would not be quiet, except he were in quarrels; and was angry, if he were not provoked: his Motto was, <hi>Dic aliquid, ut duo ſimus;</hi> Say or do ſomething, that we may be two. And we want not thoſe ſwaggering ruffians, and roaring monſters, that walk the ſtreets meerly to quarrel. Theſe are compared to the Sea, that cannot but <hi>caſt up mire and dirt;</hi> and rageth, not becauſe it is provoked, but becauſe it is unquiet. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41147:99"/> unto aſps and vipers; and thoſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that not being wronged, yet do hurt. It is as natural for the wicked to do evil, as for the fountain to run, or the fire to burn. And the cauſe of this motion of the wicked, is, not from without, but from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within. A Watch will not go, but by means of the ſpring; but the wicked heart worketh from it ſelf, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of its own accord; and ſtayeth not, no more then the pulſe in the body. The wicked needs not the devil to tempt him; for he can tempt himſelf: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſaith <hi>Nazianzen;</hi> Sin is ever ready at hand.<note place="margin">Nazianzen.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>Firſt, it may let thoſe that be of ſuch tumultuous ſpirits ſee,<note place="margin">Application</note> what a fearful caſe they are in. God would have men live in peace, and behold, they are enemies to peace; yea, they wilfully break it. Are the <hi>peace-makers bleſſed?</hi> then certainly, the peace-breakers are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Shall the peace-makers <hi>be called the ſons of God?</hi> then certainly, the peace-breakers ſhall be called the children of the devil. Is there not a <hi>wo to him by whom the offence cometh?</hi> and do they dare to give offence, to provoke others, and to begin a quarrel? Men ſhould <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider one another, to provoke to love;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith; and theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their brother, to provoke him to hoſtility; and they will wrong him, to provoke him to ſtrike again. It is required of men, that; being provoked, they ſhould forgive it; for, <hi>it is the glory of a man to ceaſe from ſtrife:</hi> but theſe provoke others, and are willingly, and wittingly, <hi>&amp; de induſtria,</hi> contentious<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Contentioſi.</hi> Words in <hi>oſus,</hi> intimate vitious habits. <hi>Aulus Gellius.</hi>
               </note> Now, are not ſuch <hi>an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord?</hi> Is it not juſt with God, that <hi>he that loveth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> ſhould be <hi>clothed with rags?</hi> that he ſhould want inward peace, and at the end of his days ſhould go to <hi>his own place,</hi> where there is nothing but tumult and confuſion?</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, I wiſh we might be <hi>provoked by a people that are not Gods people,</hi> as it is in <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 33.21.</note> that we could be as forward to good, as they are to evil: They are ready to quarrel, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer injury; and their ſword, like <hi>Joab</hi>'s, is ready to fall out of the ſcabberd, upon every occaſion; yea upon no occaſion. Oh that we were as ready (<hi>Titus</hi> 3.1.) to <hi>every good work,</hi> as ſouldiers that ſtand in their files, ready to fall on, upon the word given. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is for <hi>Emamus occaſiones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine.</note> let us buy opportunities of doing good. I wiſh we could apprehend thoſe opportunities that offer themſelves, and do, as it were, (with a ſmiling face) invite us to the embracing of them. But alas! many and many of thoſe, either we at all take no notice of, or at leaſt do not regard; but let them ſlip by, without making any uſe of them. So prone is out nature to evil, and ſo averſe to good, that in the former (like gun-powder) the leaſt ſpark taketh in us; but in the later (like green wood) much blowing will not make us burn. We flee unto evil, but we are ſcarce haled to that which is good. <hi>Alacriùs illi ad mortem, quàm nos ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam;</hi> evil ones run more chearfully to death, then we to life and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41147:100"/> goodneſs. What is there in the ways of evil that chears us, like that in the ways of piety? or is there the like reward of well and evil doing? Oh what tears are ſufficient for this inequality of our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage! Let us with trembling think of it: <hi>Conſider this, all ye that forget God.</hi> We will not, when he would; and he will not, when we would.</p>
            <p>It followeth, <hi>And every mans hand againſt him;</hi> that is, to oppoſe him. We may ſee, then,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>4.</hi> Contentious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as they are troubleſom, ſo hateful unto all men.</note>
               <hi>That the troubleſome man is hateful to all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had not <hi>Cain</hi> reaſon to think that all men would hate him, and that <hi>every man that met him,</hi> would <hi>kill him,</hi> when he had ſo ſinned againſt Nature and Religion? And well might <hi>Lamech</hi> think that people would diſtaſte him, when he was ſo full of rage, that he cared not for <hi>killing a man in his fury.</hi> And how hateful, think you, that <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that <hi>mighty hunter,</hi> was unto men! <hi>Joſhua</hi> cenſured <hi>Achan,</hi> and it enraged the people againſt him, in that he had troubled them. And if <hi>Elijah</hi> had been a <hi>troubler of Iſrael,</hi> no doubt all the people would have been againſt him. And when the Prieſts would enflame the mindes of the people againſt <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> they make them believe, that <hi>he troubleth the nation, and weakneth the hands of the people;</hi> that he ſeeks nothing but to put cauſleſs fears and jealouſies into their heads: and himſelf complaineth, that he was <hi>a man of contention.</hi> And ſo <hi>Amos</hi> ſuffereth as a man that troubleth the publike peace; and that the land was not able to endure his words. And we ſee how they incenſe the people againſt Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 16.20. <hi>This man doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly trouble our City.</hi> So at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> Acts. 17.6. <hi>Theſe men have turned the world upſide down, and are come hither alſo:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Take heed of theſe men, bend your ſelves againſt them, and caſt them out ſpeedily; for they be Incendiaries, and they raiſe tumults whereſoever they come; and therefore they are not to be endured, unleſs we mean to be enwrapped in the ſame miſeries that others have been.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Firſt, this may anſwer that complaint that ſome men and women make in the world: I am not beloved (ſay they) I cannot have the good will of my neighbours; they are ſtrange unto me, they will hold no converſation with me. Why, you are not peaceful; you are diſturbant to your neighbours; you are inimicitious to thoſe that offer you none injury; you are medling with things that belong not unto you; you are carrying tales between others; and you are ſiding with thoſe that be naught.

            <p>Thirdly, God by ſuffering ſuch men, will exerciſe the patience of his children; for being apt to be wronged by thoſe violent men, (though they offer no wrong,) there is an imployment of their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; as likewiſe of their cofidence in God, who is an harbour to put into, in all ſtorms.</p>

            <p>Laſtly, God ſuffers ſuch wilde and fierce men, and ſuch cruel people in the world, for the puniſhment of men: while they take liberty to ſin againſt him; He maketh a rod of the malice and cruelty of the wicked, to ſcourge them withall: God gave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the hands of ſuch as oppreſſed them, becauſe they had provoked him, by their foul ſins: and though it is true, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he threw thoſe rods into the fire; (as we ſee in the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and others;) yet for the preſent, he doth uſe them to chaſtiſe his own people withal; and they are very fierce againſt them.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to adde one word more, concerning this inſtance in our Text. The ferity, and fierceneſs, and ſavage dipoſition of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> and his poſterity, was a part of the puniſhment which God laid upon <hi>Sarah</hi> for adviſing, and <hi>Abraham</hi> for yeelding to take <hi>Hagar</hi> to wife.<note place="margin">Gal, 4.</note> They lived in part to ſee it: for <hi>Iſhmael mocked,</hi> yea <hi>perſecuted Iſaac,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 4.) and therefore was <hi>eaſt out,</hi> with his mother;<note place="margin">Pſal. 83.6.</note> but after their death it fell out, that the <hi>Hagarens</hi> were reckoned among the enemies of <hi>Sarahs</hi> ſeed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.

And therefore, let us ever ask counſell of God, and look that the grounds of our actions, be juſtifiable.

When, in mercies received, we forget to acknowledge God the prime agent, and to be thankful; it is the next way to make all means, for after-time, unſucceſsful. Let us learn of <hi>Hagar</hi> here: <hi>Thou Lord ſeeſt me:</hi> I have had great comfort from the Angel; but I know he was onely but thy mouth: Thou art the fountain of all my conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: It is thou, thou Lord alone, that ſeeſt and regardeſt me.</p>

               <hi>Have I alſo here looked after him that ſeeth me?</hi> that is, I have ſeen that Angel here, after I have ſeen him in my maſters houſe.

And though it be the opinion generally of the Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of many of the Latine, and ſome of our later Proteſtant Divines, that there is a particular Angel to every one; (thoſe places are urged, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>Their Angels always ſtand before God:</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, ſome make this the ſenſe: <hi>Have not I here alſo looked after him that ſeeth me?</hi> That is, Did he not ſee me firſt, before I ſaw him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was ſo indeed; and ſo it is with us all, that God ſeeth us, and ſeeketh us, and looketh after us, before we look after him, yea look up to him, or think of him; we are ſo happie, oftentimes, <hi>invenire,</hi> to finde him: But this we could not do, if he did not <hi>praevenire,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us with his grace and favour: He is fain to offer himſelf to be found, and put deſires into us of ſeeking him, or elſe we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finde nor ſeek him.

            <p>Fifthly, ſome think the emphaſis of this ſpeech to lie in the word <hi>here;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Did I ever look to finde God ſo neer me, now in this deſolate place, where all comfort failed me? Had it been in my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs houſe, upon which Gods Sun doth ever ſhine, it had not been ſo much:<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>4.</hi> The ſubſtance of Gods mercies much advanced by circumſtances, and especially in that be loved first.</note> but <hi>here,</hi> in the wilderneſs, that God ſhould look upon me, and ſpeak unto me; and, paſſing by my former errours, ſhould comfort me; this is extraordinary! Certainly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gods mercies are much advanced, according as they are circumſtantiated;</hi> as when there is but a weak beginning of them; as the captive maid is the firſt wheel in <hi>Naamans</hi> cure: when a great comfort is effected
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41147:109"/> by weak means; as <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> recovery is wrought by a bunch of figs: or when the means are made glorious; as when a great perſon helpeth a poor man in his miſery: or when the mercy cometh in a time unexpected; as the meſſage of the Angel to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when all hopes of eſcaping were paſt: or when a man is not ſo well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to receive the mercy: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was then converted, when he was in his full ſins, againſt the Church: And <hi>Hagar,</hi> when ſhe was out in rebellion: Some have met with a mercy, when they have come from lewd company: Again, the place addeth much unto it; as when <hi>Iacob</hi> hath the promiſe renewed unto him, and the viſion of the ladder in his Iourney, and when he lay in the open field: And Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that had his Revelation, in the place of his baniſhment; and certainly, that man that will work his heart,<note place="margin">Application</note> to be ſo truly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as it ought; he muſt admit the conſideration of circumſtances, and recollect himſelf, when, and where, and how, and by what meanes God afforded him, this and that favour; for, to take favours in the lumpe, and groſs: and to conſider them only in the bulk; will not ſo warm the heart, and melt it into gratitude, as the laying of them open, in all their adjuncts.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, divers do interpret it thus; I yet ſee, that is; I live though I have ſeen God: becauſe it was thought, <hi>no man could ſee God and live;</hi> I <hi>have ſeen God face to face, and my life is preſerved,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob, in way of rejoycing, Gen.</hi> 32. Nay they were conceited,<note place="margin">Gen. 32.30.</note> that if they had but ſeen an Angell, they ſhould dye. As we ſee in <hi>Gideon,</hi> Iudg. 6.22. <hi>perceiving it to be the Angell of the Lord;</hi> he ſaid, <hi>alas O Lord God; for I have ſeen an Angell of the Lord, face to face: But the Lord ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, peace be unto thee, fear not, thou ſhalt not dye: Manoah ſaid to his wife, we ſhall ſurely dye, becauſe we have ſeen God, Iudg.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">Iudg. 13.22.</note> And the ſouldiers, upon the apparition of the Angell, <hi>did ſhake for fear, and became as dead men, Mat.</hi> 28.4.</p>

               <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Lydia:</hi> It is his will we ſhould ſubmit unto the miniſtery of men. And certainly, though our curious mindes may ſtand to Gods immediate ſpeaking, or the miniſtery of Angels; yet, as we ſhould not be able to endure it, ſo not to profit by it: for, that ſpeech of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> to the rich man, who would have <hi>one ſent from the dead</hi> to his brethren, will ſerve us in this caſe: <hi>If they will not hear Moſes and the Prophets, they will not hear an Angel.</hi>

            <p>I come to the next verſe, wherein her thankfulneſs doth appear, in giving a name to the Well, where the Angel had met with her: for it is probable, that ſhe gave the name, and that afterwards others took it up, and commonly called it by that name.

            <p>Much good (therefore) do it the Pagans with their idols; and the Papiſts, who are worſe then Pagans, with their images, becauſe they have more light: They would have people believe (belike,) that they are living ones; for ſometimes, (they ſay) they look with a cheerfull countenance, and ſometimes they turn away in diſlike; they turn their eyes, they weep, they move their hands, they nod their heads; but theſe are gulleries, to fool children withall; wiſe men know theſe impoſtures: God give them better minds, then to make the Scripture a mute judg, and images lay-mens books: God turn their hearts from theſe vanities; let us ſerve him that is the living God, in Spirit and truth; and ever acknowledg him, to be the only true God; <hi>God bleſſed for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond Uſe is, that we prize life, as the <hi>Rachel,</hi> the moſt beautiful <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>2</label> of all Gods bleſſings; and certainly life muſt needs be excellent, when God is ſtiled the living God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, life maketh the firſt diviſion of things; there is nothing before life, but being; and being maketh no diſtinction of things; for that can be nothing, that hath no being; and therefore thoſe creatures that have life, we eſteem before thoſe that have it not; how noble ſoever otherwiſe: <hi>a living dog, is better then a dead lyon:</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ</hi> 9.4.) And the pooreſt worm that crawleth,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.4.</note> is more glorious in this reſpect, then the frame of Heaven and Earth; in that it liveth, and the other doth not.</p>
            <p>And again, Thirdly, the greateſt happineſs that men ſhall ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto, the happineſs of Heaven, is ſet out by life. O let us then prize this bleſſing, and let us not be fooliſhly prodigall of it; like ſome, who by their contention and quarrelſomneſs, and being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to every duell, hazard it; nor like others, that dig their own graves, by intemperance, and ſo dye in <hi>tempere non ſuo,</hi> before their time, ſcarce live out half their days: Such as refuſe meat or drink, or phyſick, for the preſervation of life; ſhew a flat undervaluing, if not a contempt of that great Iewell; and as we are to prize it for the worth of it; ſo we are to be truly thankfull to the Doner, for it, and that is the living God. Some men think they are beholding to their food, and to their good ſtomack, and able concoction: Alas; who giveth food? Of whom doeſt thou beg thy <hi>daily bread.</hi> 2. When thou haſt meate, who giveth thee an Appetite? how many have meat before them, and yet they loath the ſight of it: 3. When a man hath eaten with an Appetite, who give thit power to nouriſh? there be thoſe that have a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>i.e.</hi> a defect of nouriſhment; it is moſt true that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>man liveth not by bread only, but by every word that commeth out of the mouth of God:</hi> that is, the word of Gods bleſſing: we owe our life then, and the ſupport of it, unto God; who if he did not ſupply <hi>oyle,</hi> our <hi>Lamps</hi> would quickly go out. And if we muſt be thankful for life barely, then much more for health, which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41147:113"/> is the perfection of life: for <hi>non eſt vivere, ſed valere vita;</hi> not to be, but to be well, is to live, to live in health: It is true, we muſt be thankfull,<note place="margin">Exod. 22.29.</note> even for Penury and want. <hi>Thou ſhalt not delay to offer thy firſt fruits, and thy liquors, Exod.</hi> 22.

But when God is pleaſed, to give us not only life, but a latitude of health, how much are we bound unto him! What light is to an houſe, that health is to a man; what comfort hath a man in an houſe (though never ſo well furniſhed) if he have not light? And what comfort in a mans greateſt poſſeſſion, if he have not health? Let us then (I ſay) be thankfull, to the living God for it; and let us be affraid to turn the edge of ſo great a bleſſing, againſt God himſelf, and wrong him with his own gift; as they do, that ſpend their health in luſt, in exceſs, in gaming, and other vain and ſinful courſes: do we live through the bounty of this living God; and ſhall we live to his diſhonour? can we not ſubſiſt one moment, without his ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hand? and dare we miſpend this talent? <hi>non hos quaeſitum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in uſus,</hi> this was not beſtowed to ſuch ends: God giveth <hi>Iſrael</hi> corn, and wine, and oyle, and they offer them to <hi>Baal:</hi> and ſo he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us life, and health, and do we ſacrifice it to ſin? but as he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to take thoſe things from them; ſo it is juſt to take away our life, that we thus miſ-employ, and grieve him withall.</p>

            <p>Secondly, we may conclude alſo, that ſhe was received again by <hi>Sarah,</hi> upon her humiliation and ſubmiſſion; and all former errours forgotten.</p>
            <q>This pious and charitable diſpoſition hath been found in Gods people:<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>5.</hi> Forgiving diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, are badges of Gods people.</note>
            </q>
            <p>As we ſee in <hi>Joſeph</hi> toward his brethren: they ſought unto him for mercy, and that he would forgive their unnaturalneſs; and he did it. And ſo in <hi>Moſes:</hi> how eaſily did he pardon his brother &amp; ſiſter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede to God for her, and the people, that often murmured at him?
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41147:116"/> So <hi>David</hi> forgave his ſon <hi>Abſalon,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> that perſecuted him; and <hi>Shimei,</hi> that curſed him, when he ſought unto him. So <hi>Samuel,</hi> though the people reviled him, yet he pardoneth them, and prayeth for them; yea, thinketh he ſhould ſin, if he did it not. So <hi>Daniel</hi> paſſed by the wrong the Wiſe-men did him, and is a means to ſave their lives. Thus Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> freely forgave his perſecutors, without any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them; and, in the midſt of that ſhower of ſtones, prayeth for them. And ſo did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by the Jews, and our bleſſed Lord by his perſecutors. And I doubt not but <hi>Philemon</hi> did what <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him, in regard of <hi>Oneſimus.</hi> And thus divers of the Worthies did, of former times: The bleſſed Martyrs have freely forgiven thoſe that have wronged them. That which hath wrought them to this, hath been.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the conſideration of the common frailty of nature; how apt people are to offend, and do wrong.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the meditation of their own frailty; that they may be ſo tempted, that they may be injurious to others: and what they would have done to themſelves, in the like caſe, they are willing to do to others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the obſervation of Gods dealing with others; who doth <hi>forgive iniquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> 
               <hi>tranſgreſsion, and ſin,</hi> as he is deſcribed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. even foul ſins, crimſon, ſcarlet-iniquities, upon humiliation; <hi>Davids</hi> adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Murder, <hi>Manaſſehs</hi> Necromancie, <hi>Peters</hi> denial of his Maſter, <hi>Pauls</hi> perſecution of the Church.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the conſideration of Gods dealing with themſelves; how mercifully he hath received them, upon their repentance and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: and they muſt <hi>be followers of God, as dear children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the Uſe of this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>Firſt, it meets with thoſe to whom this is <hi>durus ſermo,</hi> an hard ſaying. What, forgive an injury? No; retain wrath, and revenge the injury to the full. What, upon ſubmiſſion, and craving pardon, to put up this? That were to be poor-ſpirited. How many are there, even fathers to their children, maſters to their ſervants, one man to another, whom nothing will ſatisfie; no mediation of friends, no prayers or tears, or acknowledgements, appeaſe! Nay, they ſuffer not onely <hi>the ſun</hi> of the day to <hi>go down upon their wrath,</hi> and many ſuns; but even the ſun of their life ſets in this black cloud. Yea, ſo malicious they be, that they think their children unworthy to inherite their poſſeſſions, unleſs they will be heirs of their malice, and to proſecute a revengeful courſe ſet on foot by them; as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Hannibal</hi> took an oath of him, bound at the Altar, that he ſhould never have peace with <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do theſe people at any time remember, that it was one of thoſe fearful ſins that God gave up the Heathen unto, in his juſt judgement, to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.30.</note> that is, implacable. Do they (2.) think of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their begging forgiveneſs of God, and how they ſeal up their
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41147:116"/> own judgement. 3. If, from any one vitious affection, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a nullity of grace, ſurely from this: <hi>God is love;</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is malice: and it is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,<note place="margin">Chryſoſtome.</note> (as the Greek Father ſaith.) It is the moſt proper affection of the devil, to be an irreconcileable enemy.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, let us labour for this godly and charitable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to forgive others their offences; yea, as our Saviour faith, to <hi>ſeventy times ſeven times.</hi> And let us but ſet before us the example of God, who, upon repentance, receiveth us; and it will anſwer all objections. When the Fleſh ſaith, He is baſe that hath wronged me; ſhall I forgive him?

               </gap>. I, but ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not the firſt time: And did never God but once forgive thee? But thirdly, he will do it again: And wilt thou never more offend God? I, but fourthly, it beſeemeth not my place. Why, is thy place greater then Gods? Fifthly, I ſhall be counted a coward. Is God ſo, for forgiving? Think often, how thou carrieſt thy ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and thou wilt be more inclinable to forgive thy brother his offences toward thee.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, <hi>And Hagar bare Abraham a ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here might be obſerved, how faithfully God performeth what he promiſed: for the Angel had ſaid this from God, and now it is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. But of this plentifully heretofore; as likewiſe of that which might be noted out of the diſpoſition of the name by <hi>Abraham;</hi> it is in the power of the father: He was advertiſed by <hi>Hagar,</hi> what the Angel had ſaid concerning the childes name; and now, according to his right and place, he doth impoſe it. The wife may ſuggeſt, and adviſe, and counſel; but ſhe may not uſurp that power and right of the husband.</p>
            <p>The laſt verſe is onely a Chronologie of <hi>Abrahams</hi> age when <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> was born unto him; which affordeth little matter of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I will therefore conclude with this:</p>
            <p>This good man, <hi>Abraham,</hi> in his old age, hath a ſon: Though it be not the iſſue which God intended him, yet it is a comfort unto him.</p>
            <q>God crowneth the old-age of his ſervants with many comforts.<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>6. Aqua vitae</hi> for old-age; and what crowns that with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note>

            </p>
            <p>For the Uſe:</p>
            <p>Let thoſe that are aged bleſs God for thoſe comforts he affordeth them; and above all, let them bleſs God for a <hi>good old-age,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Application</note> when God

            <p>I pray therefore, Let us that are old, above all comforts, labour for this: It is woful to ſee one that is declining in body, yet worſe in ſoul; to be neer the grave, and far from heaven: to hear old people blaſpheme and ſwear, to be exceſſive, to be luſtful, and, even when ſtrength is gone, to talk <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
